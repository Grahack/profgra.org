A few hours later, the site glitched. Users couldn’t tweet; they couldn’t DM; #TwitterDown began trending. All of it — the muddled sense of identity, the breakdown of basic function — confirmed the sense that Twitter, a site that has hosted the global conversation for almost two decades, had become a rickety shell of itself, that its best days were behind it and that it would never be as significant again.\n\nBut what, exactly, is being lost? We wanted to capture the ways that Twitter — a platform used by a tiny percentage of the world’s population — changed how we protest, consume news, joke and, of course, argue. So we set ourselves to the task of sorting through the trillions of tweets sent since 2006 to determine which were just noise and which deserved a place in the history books. And then we asked: Could we maybe even … rank them?\n\nWhat you see below is our list, compiled with the help of experts, of the 25 most important tweets. Like all such rankings, we hope it can serve as a starting point for discussions and arguments, both on Twitter and off. What was ranked too high? Too low? What did we leave off?\n\nYes, we know: There’s something a little absurd about this exercise. Twitter contains such a wide range of humanity: How do you rank the tweet that got Justine Sacco canceled against the tweet that ignited #MeToo?\n\nAnd yet this list tells a bigger story about how 17 years of messy, vibrant, sometimes ugly, always lively conversation has shaped the world. Just where did “Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” land compared with “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet”? You’ll have to scroll to find out.\n\n**How We Did It****:** To compile this ranking, Times Opinion rounded up a group of panelists with widely varied backgrounds but one thing in common: They know a lot about Twitter. (The full list of panelists is at the bottom of the article.) We asked them to submit tweets they thought were good candidates for the most important of all time, with the only criterion being that the tweets had to be in English. We used these to create a list, then sent that list back out to our panelists with instructions to rank the tweets in order of importance and to share their insights about them: why they thought a tweet was important or why it wasn’t. We then crunched the numbers and compiled their insights, edited for content and clarity, into the list you see here.\n\nNo. 1\n\n![](https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2023-01-12-op-bestweets/11b10a98ba67d9c7c10543bd3d941e136f1b4682/_assets/profilepic_alyssamilano_archival.png)\n\n@Alyssa_Milano\n\nAlyssa_Milano\n\nIf you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.\n\n![](https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2023-01-12-op-bestweets/11b10a98ba67d9c7c10543bd3d941e136f1b4682/_assets/milano-media.jpeg)\n\nOct 15, 2017 ![](https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2023-01-12-op-bestweets/11b10a98ba67d9c7c10543bd3d941e136f1b4682/_assets/icon-retweet.svg) 19.8K ![](https://static01.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2023-01-12-op-bestweets/11b10a98ba67d9c7c10543bd3d941e136f1b4682/_assets/icon-heart.svg) 46K\n\nBackstory\n\nThe idea of #MeToo, first raised by the activist Tarana Burke, had been around for more than a decade before October 2017.

Play only what you hear.\n2. If you don't hear anything, don't play anything.\n3. Don't let your fingers and limbs just wander - place them\n   intentionally.\n4. Don't improvise on endlessly - play, something with intention,\n   develop it or not, but then, end off, take a break.\n5. Leave space - create space - intentionally create places where\n   you don't play.\n6. Make your sound blend. Listen to your sound and adjust it to\n   the rest of the band and the room.\n7. If you play more than one instrument at a time - like a drum\n   kit or multiple keyboards - make sure that they are balanced\n   with one another.\n8. Don't make any of your music mechanically or just through\n   patterns of habit. Create each sound, phrase, and piece with\n   choice - deliberately.\n9. Guide your choice of what to play by what you like - not by\n   what someone else will think.\n10. Use contrast and balance the elements: high/low, fast/slow,\n   loud/soft, tense/relaxed, dense/sparse.\n11. Play to make the other musicians sound good. Play things\n   that willl make the overall music sound good.\n12. Play with a relaxed body. Always release whatever tension\n   you create.\n13. Create space - begin, develop and end phrases with intention.\n14. Never beat or pound your instrument - play it easily and gracefully.\n15. Create space - then place something in it.\n16.

Set aside separate\n  time for playing, preferably after the practice session.\n- Record a practice session. The purpose here is not to record an exercise,\n  but to record how you are practicing. Schedule at least an hour for\n  your session, choose one or two things (not more) that youd like to\n  focus on before you start, and then set a timer and work on them\n  exclusively for 20 minutes. Afterwards, just play for as long as you\n  want, having the most fun with the least amount of pressure possible.\n- Experience how it feels to do just what you set out to do, secure in the\n  knowledge that youll still have enough time to do whatever you want\n  to do later on. Did the practicing feel different? If yes, how so? Was\n  the playing more enjoyable?\n- Did you find that you could have outlined more clearly exactly what\n  you wanted to practice?\n- Did you feel a heightened sense of focus and productivity from the\n  awareness that you were being recorded?\n- Listen back to the recording and see how you did. Write down what\n you find out and save these notes for later.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Your environment infuences the likelihood of whether you will\n  practice or not.\n- Visualize your ultimate practice space.\n- Get out a pen and paper and use the brainstorming method: Write\ndown anything and everything that comes to mind, allowing yourself\nto dream big without criticizing or deleting.\n- Go through your wish list and make as many improvements as\n  possible-maybe choose the 3 things that would make the biggest\n  difference right away.\n- Size up your instrument and the environment around it; try to ix\n  whatever is missing.\n- Think about your process. Can you optimize your commute or any\n  rituals before and after? This could mean something big, like finding a\n  new practice space or replacing a smelly rug, or something small, like\n  simply treating yourself to a coffee after each practice session.\n- Make this space your own. Make it fun and do it now!\n\n### Practicing anywhere\n\n- Consider the three parameters of size, volume, and portability, and\n  how they apply to vour instrument. Recognize how they might pose\n  limitations to your practice time.\n- Research alternatives and brainstorm about ways to change these\n  parameters or even free yourself from these limitations.\n- Review the settings in your daily routine and think about how\n  you could transtorm them into new practice environments. Look\n  at traveling and waiting times, your living space, your workplace,\n  vacation stays, and so on.\n- Set up a satellite or stripped-down practice area in your home,\n  especially if you are used to practicing in a separate rehearsal space.\n  Could you squeeze in some practice time while someone else takes a\n  nap?\n- Develop an appreciation for these alternative practice setups and\n  the advantages they offer. For instance, I made a list of the places and\n  daytimes I can practice with a pad where I couldn't with a real drum set.\n- Lastly, brainstorm about ways to gain access to a real instrument that\n  you havent thought of before. Some people conclude too easily that\n  they have to live with a stripped-down version all the time. Could\n  you ask a friend, music school, community center, or church about\n  spending time with a real piano or drum set one night a week or once\n  a month? Ask around-you might be surprised to find your efforts\n  rewarded.\n\n### Practicing without your instrument\n\n- Remember that some exercises can help improve your playing and\ndon't require you to have an instrument in your hands at all.\n- Come up with a list of all the ways you could practice without your\ninstrument. Note this isn't an \"either/or\" scenario; some things you've\npracticed exclusively on your instrument so far can show up here as\nwell.\n- Choose one song you are working on and take a few complete passes\nonly in your head. Then play it on your instrument and see if there's\nbeen any improvement.\n- Be resourceful! Download a metronome app like Gap Click by Benny\nGreb, which will help improve yourability to keep tempo and heighten\nyour awareness of subdivision, whether youre with or without your\ninstrument.\n\n### A different look at discipline\n\n- Realize that self-discipline is your friend that serves you, that works\nfor you.\n- Self-discipline is freedom, because it gets you where you want to be.\n- In order for this friend to help you, you absolutely have to become\ncrystal clear about what you want and why you want it. This is what\ngives your everyday actions purpose, and helps you remember that the\nchallenge is worth it, even when the journey gets tough.\n- Make the important choice to be loyal to your future, not your past.\n\nAs soon as you become clear about what you want and can consistently\ndemonstrate your progress towards this goal, you will find out that you\nhave more discipline than you think. Many musicians think they lack\ndiscipline, when all they need is a more disciplined approach.\n\n### Motivation\n\n- Write down at least things that you once wished, aspired to\nhoped for, that you achieved and now maybe even take for granted\nRemember vividly how much you wanted this. Was it being able\nto play a certain piece of music: Attaining a certain piece of\nCollaborating with a mentor? Getting together with someone or\nmoving to a new place? Whatever it may be, focus on the things su you\nwished tor, wanted to come true, and then made happen.\n- For each goal you've identified, write down the steps that por vo\nthere, or in other words, what worked? Then draw a line, and also\nwrite down what didn't work, the efforts you considered a waste of\ntime that later proved to have helped, and anything else that comes to\nmind. Write it all down and analyze.\n- The point here is that youre not starting from scratch; you can learn\nfrom your evperiences. You've already made things happen, and it's\nYes, we learn from our istakes, as they say-but don't forget to learn\nmnottant to understand what worked and repeat those behaviors.\nfrom your successes, too.\n- Don't just get busy for the sake of being busy. Find out what you want\nand why you want it. What is the reason that makes it worthwhile\nto put in your time and effort? And does this reason really mean\nsomething to you?\n- Choose the process that's most likely to get you where you want to\ngo. Is this the right exercise for what I want to improve? Is this exactly\nwhat I should be focusing on? Since we can't predict the future, it's\nOK that this can only ever be a best guess, but make sure it is directly\nconnected to the reason why you are practicing. Your why should help\nyou determine this.\n- When you don't feel motivated, find out where the error is. Remember\nit can be one of two things: 1) Is your why not clear enough? or 2) Are\nyou not confident that the merhod you chose is the right one? Dont\nnange your goal if it's merely your approach that needs changings\n- Measure your progress regularly. Don't rely on your intuition here.\nUse recordings and journaling to compare where you are now to\nwhere you started.\n\n### Attitude\n\n- Don't be a perfectionist; strive every day to \"do the best you can with\nwhat you have right now. If you add in some planning and long-term\nperspective, I believe this is a grounded approach that will serve you\nnot only when it comes to practicing, but in all aspects from business\nto family life.\n- Practice like it matters, because it does. This can be as easy as reminding\nyourself not to fall into the \"It doesn't matter trap\" and making a\nconscious decision to be more mindful. Record yourself often, and\nenjoy the heightened focus that comes with getting into \"performance\nmode\". Keep in mind that the way you practice definitely shapes the\nway you will pertorm and, whať's more, it can even help make your\npertormance way more fun.\n- Cultivate gratitude in your life. For example, for the past few years,\npart of my morning ritual has been to ask, \"What are the three things\nl am grateful for today?\" My family started to adopt this as well, so we\nsit down to breakfast and tell each other. You can also write them down\nin a journal. What comes to mind? Is it having good health, safety,\nopportunity, and love in your life? Maybe you can even be gratetul\nfor the challenges you have right now, since you could certainly have\ndifferent ones.\n- Spread gratitude regularly. Leave a voice message for a good friend or\ncall up a family member just to let them know you're grateful to have\nthem in your life. It's so damn simple, yet can have such a massive\nimpact. Cmon - try it right now.\n- Remember that even what may seem like the most stupid and useless\ntasks can give you beautiful experiences and lessons, not to mention\nunexpected results, when you do them really well. Great questions to\nask vourself here are: How can I do this well? How can I make this fun\nwhile still respecting the task? How else can I get the job done? and\nlastly, How can I do this with greater calm and focus?\n\n### I don't have enough time\n\n- **Set timer/take notes.** Decide how and where you want to take notes. It\nmay be most practical to use a smartphone as your timer and a notepad\napp as your journal, but really, any kind of timer and notebook will do.\nThe critical factor here is this: You absolutely have to have them with you\nat all times. Trust me, otherwise it wont work. You'll probably find the\nmost game-changing realizations in situations that seem like, \"Oh, I'll\nremember this\" or \"This doesn't carry much weight.\" No you won't, and\nYes it does! Dont trust your memory - write it all down!\n- **Dont freak out! Just observe.** Set the timer and take notes - this is really\nall vou have to do. Just do it. Don't try to make it perfect. No need to\nbeat yourself up. Maybe for the first time in your life you're gaining some\ninsight as to where your time actually goes, and this is good. You don't\nhave to change anything just yet, simply be a neutral observer. Use any\ntool you can to help reconstruct your day as accurately as possible: your\ncalendar, your browser history - heck, these days your phone can tell you\nexactly how many minutes you spent on a call. Write it all down.\n- **Do this for 10 days.** Even though after two days you might be thinking\n\"I've got it! I know what to do!\" and are eager to get started on your new\nroutine, please keep this going for a full 10 days. Why? Because 10 days\nis more than one week, so you'll have at least a full week to observe and\nan identify patterns that may be repeated at the beginning of the second\nweek. Time-logging can help us pinpoint the trivial activities you can stop\ndoing, but more importantly the activity patterns, or in other words, the\nthings you do regularly. The biggest improvements are likely to come from\nchanging patterns, not isolated activities. So do it for 10 days.\n\n### How often should I practice\n\n- If you only do it once in a while, dont be mad if you only see results\n  once in a while.\n- Don't worry that a bad practice session or a bad day will mess up\neverything. By the same token, don't get overexcited if you're lucky and\nsomething comes out right for once. Test the reliability of your output,\nand get used to making a little bit of progress consistently. This will have\na larger impact than a long weekend of killing yourself, especially if it's a\none-off. Consistency is key.\n- Remember the examples of the tuning challenge and the archery\nlesson. A tiny shift in habit and direction now will make a tremendous\nimpact in the long run.\n- What tiny shift in your daily life could you make? What kind of shift\nwould serve you on your instrument? Whatever comes to mind here,\nstart now and keep it consistent.\n- Consciously leverage the dramatic long-term effects of habits, routines,\nand rituals, for they will shape your future more than isolated incidents.\n\n### When is the best time to practice\n\n- There are many benefits to having regular practice times. Willpower\ndoesn't last, but a ritual can last a lifetime.\n- Think about what you can do to incorporate practicing in a such way\nthat it becomes an \"of course\" thing for you.\n- See if you can attach your practice time to another part of your usual\nroutine, like before rehearsal, after work, or before going to the gym.\n- Experiment to find your sweet spots - find out what type you are.\nWhat feels better: to wake up early and practice betore everything else\ngets going, or are you a night owl? You have the luxury of making your\nown personal choice here, but don't get hung up on it. Honor your\npreference, but don't use it as an excuse.\n- If you catch yourself overthinking it, remember the down-to-earth\nwisdom of the fitness trainer and just practice whenever you can\nEighty percent of success is just showing up.\n\n### Distraction/focus\n\n- **Make sure you are clear!** Remember that in order to stay on track,\nthere has to be one. Do you know specifically what you want to do in\nthis practice session? The more narrowly you define this, the easier it\nwill be to stick to it.\n- **Communicate with yourself and others.** Take the time to manage\nexpectations and revise commitments to yourself and others. Of\ncourse, the more ritualized and consistent your practice time is, the\nless negotiation will be required and less resistance will crop up.\n- **Leave your luggage at the door.** Place a little notebook near your\ninstrument or outside the door to your practice room. Make it a ritual\nto do a brain dump of whatever is on your mind that you don't want\nto forget but won't need while practicing. Write it all down, and then\nplace it in front of the door where you won't forget it on your way out.\n- **Minimize potential input.** One of the most eftective ways to deal\nwith interruptions is to prevent them. Switch off the internet, your\nphone, any notifications and incoming messages of any kind. Can\nyou disable the doorbell? Is there unfinished business in the room that\ngrabs your attention? Get rid of it!\n\n### The 3 must have tools for practicing\n\nTimer, recording device, journal.\n[I the skipped the keypoints]\n\n### How to deal with frustration and judgement\n\n- Be as respectful towards yourself as you would be to a good friend\nwhom you are trying to help. Operate in reality; see your playing for\nwhat it is, but also no worse than it is. Next time you listen to a\nrecording of yourself, start by writing down three things you like about\nit. If you're struggling, make this an exercise in itself and try rephrasing\nit this way: \"If I had to like any three things about this, what would\nthey be?\" Only then are you allowed to move on to writing down three\nthings you'd like to improve.  \nNote that language is really important here. Dont seize upon three\nthings that you hate, don't like, or always suck. Choose three things\nthat you want to improve or could execute better. I do this myself\nand have suggested this exercise to many students of mine, including\nkids who are having difficulty and especially teenagers. Become good\nat being kind to yourself and taking a more objective view of your\noutput.\n\n- Measure your own progress - don't compare your journey to what you\nassume to be true about anyone else. Make recordings of your practice\nsessions and compare them to each other. Acknowledge not just the\ncompletion of a major project or challenging thing you are working\non, but also the smallest of incremental changes and take a moment\nto celebrate them consciously.\n- Use the \"interesting\" and \"relax, refocus\" mantras. At your next\npractice session, pay particular attention to your self-talk and how\nyou react when frustration or impatience comes up. Try saying the\n\"Interesting\" mantra out loud and, if you want, add a smile. Problems\nhate it when you talke a moment to breathe and then smile at them.\n\n### The checklist cycle\n\nBODY\n\n- Can I sit more upright?\n- Are my shoulders back and down?\n- Are my elbows out? Can I let them hang loosely while I'm doing what\n  I'm doing?\n- Is there any unnecessary tension in my face, neck, shoulders, arms\n  back, legs, or hands?\n\nTECHNIQUE\n\n- How much more relaxed can I play this?\n- Can I use less motion? Or as I like to think of it: Can I use a smaller\n  gear? This means, am I using my whole arm for this motion when I\n  can manage it with my just forearm, wrist, or fingers? For my feet, can\n  I rest my foot on the ground when iť's not in use?\n\nSOUND\n\n- Am I playing too loud?\n- Are the notes that should be at the same volume level sounding tne\n  same?\n- Can it be more even?\n- Are the accents distinguishable from the nonaccented notes\n\nTIME\n\n- Can I sing/feel the quarter-note pulse over what I'm playing?\n- Is the subdivision even? Does it flow?\n- Can I sing a half-time groove over this?\n\nHow to use this list?\n\n- Start with my checklist and apply it to whatever you're working on\nat the moment. Write it down or make a copy, and then position\nit where you can take a peek without having to stop playing. One\nstudent shared that he uses a timer to prompt himself to move on to\nthe next item; whatever works for you. I'm confident you will start to\nsee ultraquick improvements in your practicing.\n- As soon as you've gotten the hang of it, don't stop there. Please modify\nand customize the checklist to fit your needs, whether this means\nadding something that feels missing or crossing something out. Make\nit yours and use it.\n\n### How to tackle big things by making them small\n\n- Try out both variations on the whale method, salami slice and\nsandwich, and use these next bullet points as your quick guide.\n- Take a challenging phrase you want to work on, set its lenght as the\nloop, start a metronome, and get a feel for the form.\n- Focus only on the first note and try to get it right; after that, relax until\nits your turn again.\n- Whatever you've built up must feel good before you're allowed to add\nthe next note.\n- Dont get impatient. Only add one new note at a time.\n- Whenever you get overwhelmed and have trouble adding the next\nnote, go back to the version before, which you can handle without\nsacrificing tempo, form, sound quality, and relaxation.\n- Whatever happens, keep the form.\n\n### What to practice?\n\n- First of all, relax and realize that not everything is equally important\nand urgent. In fact, most things dont really matter, or at least don't\nmatter right now. lt's OK to not give them your energy in the form of\nyour thoughts and attention. When you do this, you'll be blown away\nby how much energy you have left for the things that do matter.\n- Get comfortable with the fact that in order to progress in one area,\nyou will probably end up neglecting another. That's OK. That's what\na decision means. The word *decision* comes from the Latin word\n*decidere*, \"to cut off.\"\n- When we set up your personal EPM system, we will find out exactly\nwhere you want to go in relation to where you are right now. And\nthis will give us a very clear understanding about what the next step\nis - or for our purposes, *what* to practice - using the same reasoning\nprocess that helps you decide what to have for breakfast, and allows\nyou to advise a pedestrian on the street which direction to take once\nyou know the destination.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Effet-Dunning-Kruger":{"title":"Effet Dunning-Kruger","content":"#draft\n\n# Effet Dunning-Kruger\n\nEn bref: Les moins bons ne doutent pas.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Elements-of-style":{"title":"Elements of style","content":"# Elements of style\n\n[Page Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Exo-de-la-bataille-de-notes":{"title":"Exo de la bataille de notes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Exo-du-nimp-r%C3%A9solu":{"title":"Exo du nimp résolu","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Exo-du-rythme-solide":{"title":"Exo du rythme solide","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Freinet":{"title":"Freinet","content":"#peda \n\n# Freinet\n\n- ICEM\n- Pédagogie d'action directe\n- Pédagogie syndicale vs emancipatrice\n- L'expérimentation pédagogique doit se garder de toute mise sous tutelle et de tout phagocytage, autant le résignation et le repli sur le seul univers scolaire ne saurait lui [cf] tenir lieu d'horizon.\n- ...

monde coche aucune case.\n\n## Introduction\n\n* Exemples de patients\n* Tim Berne, fondateur Analyse Transactionnelle\n  «écoute martienne»\n* p10: Bof «... sont évidemment proportionnels à l'intelligence »\n* p11: «écartelé entre idéalisme absolu et lucidité extrême»\n* p12: termes, Jeanne Siaux Facchin:.\"zèbre\"\n* p15: diagonal sans e\n\n## Partie 1\n\n### Chap 1 Des capteurs hypersensibles\n\nAttention aux détails \n\n- L'hyperesthésie\n  - description de l'attente dans la salle d'attente\n  - les 5 sens sont aiguisés et toujours en alerte\n  - ce qui peut vite devenir gênant\n    (signaux trop forts mais peut être perçu\n    comme inquisiteur) \n- H visuelle\n  - aussi sensible à la luminosité\n- H auditive\n  - bof: «entendre plusieurs sons simultanément»\n    car tout le monde en est capable\n  - Radio et conversation, mais dérangés par bruits\n  - bof: sensibles aux graves ou lointains\n- H kinesthésique \n  - ambiance, humidité, rugosité\n  - sont tactiles \n- H olfactive\n    - ...\n- H gustative\n    - Bof: il n'y a que quatre goûts\n\nLes non H peuvent paraître abrutis ou\nengourdis aux H, mais c'est une réalité \nphysiologique.\n\n- Édéisme, contemplation, une fausse note au milieu d'un morceau.\n- Synesthésie, activation croisée des sens.\n- Bizarrerie esthésique: lécher une cuiller en bois.\n- Inhibiteurs d'info: leur manque produit une gêne,\n  car pas de tri, de hiérarchisation des info.\n\n\u003e D'une manière générale, dans leur vie quotidienne, les surefficients mentaux ont du mal à faire des choix et à décider de ce qui est important et de ce qui ne l'est pas. \n\nEt autres descriptions de situations difficiles\ncomme «c'est bon c'est qu'un couche)+r de soleil».\n\n### Chap 2 De l'hypersensibilité à l'hyperlucidité\n\n- Captent beaucoup des éléments «généralement inconscient»\n  (je n’aime pas trop la formulation), ce qui occasionne de la gêne (p37).\n- Ont un intérêt, une l’attention, une capacité à se sentir concernés plus fortes. (p38).\n- Explications avec les hémisphères et «cœeur avant cerveau» (bof),\n  ce qui occasionne des montagnes russes émotives (le Quotient Émotif\n  mesure le contrôle des pulsions). La clef est la connaissance de soi.\n\n#### Hyper affectivité\n\nBesoin d’affection, égo faible donc sensibles au jugement d’autrui (p41),\nVoir Jill Bolte Taylor (AVC qui l’a privée temporairement d’un hémisphère).\n\n#### Gestion du stress\n\nSi panique, l’amygdale émet du cortisol et de l’adrénaline.\nElle est court-circuité par la morphine et la kétamine.\nÀ ce moment il peut y avoir déconnexion, voire dissociation (p44).\n\nLes surefficients ont un seuil bas, sont donc toujours un peu sur\nle qui-vive, mais peuvent dissocier souvent.\n\n#### Hyperempathie\n\nCaptent et ressentent l’état émotionnel des autres, même les inconnus.\nOccasionne une gêne, par exemple la peur de la foule mais aussi une\ncertaine compréhension des autres (p47).\n\nDésintéressés, jamais ne font le mal.\n\n#### Télépathie (p49)\n\nC’est parfois gênant, mais aussi gênant de ne pas être deviné en retour.\n\n#### Hyperlucidité\n\n\u003e p.50 Je vois tout, je sais tout, rien ne m’échappe […] je sais instantanément à qui\n\u003e j’ai affaire. Ce n’est pas que je veuille savoir, c’est que je ne peux pas ne pas voir […]\n\nSelon moi on se fait *tous* une idée des gens, qu'on\ncroit être la bonne.\n\nLe syndrôme de Cassandre et ses trois lectures (p52):\n\n1. souffrance et isolement car rabroués\n2. incapacité à «hurler avec les loups»\n3. savoir développer des capacités de persuasion\n\nLaisser chacun évoluer à son rythme, savoir se taire si on ne veut pas être entendu,\nou juste poser des questions.\n\nLes expériences mystiques (p55): quand compris, reconnus et en confiance,\nsi interlocuteur capable d’écouter, on a comme des expériences paranormales.\nAprès ça part un peu en bof, sauf «n’oubliez pas votre bon sens sur la quête de la\nspiritualité».\n\nPrenez le temps, maintenant, de voir fonctionner ces capteurs si sensibles.\n\n### Chap 3: Un câblage neurologique différent (p59)\n\n#### Les différences entre cerveau droit (CD) et cerveau gauche (CG)\n\nExpérience des deux dessins évoquant des visages\nalors que ce ne sont que des traits.\n\nCG: traits et courbes et peut-être un 2, fonctionnement linéaire,\nautonomie et individualisme.\n\nCD: visage et émotions (CD ne sait pas expliquer car pas de langage),\nfonctionnement à l’intuition, au global, dans l’instant présent,\naltruisme et générosité.\n\nLes codes en vigueur en Occident conviennent aux personnes dont le CG\ndomine. Des conseils sont donnés pour développer CG et CD, mais aussi\npour apprendre à s’accepter.\n\n#### Surefficience mentale (p65)\n\n##### Une pensée en arborescence\n\nExemple de l’exposé sur la Renaissance en Italie, où chaque idée en fait\njaillir 10, et récursivement. C’est créatif mais aussi handicapant.\nUne idée: le fil conducteur du contemporain pour structurer.\n\nSi éparpillement: «pourquoi est-ce que je fais cela?»,\n«quel est mon but principal?».\n\np67: la pensée en arborescence est efficace pour la recherche\ndes solutions, se faisant naturellement et parfois inconsciemment,\nsans savoir forcément expliquer pourquoi c’est la solution.\nRaisonnement moins scolaire au sens occidental.\n\n##### Le besoin de complexité (p68)\n\nLa pensée fonctionne en mode automatique,\nelle se perd (rêveur, distrait, désorganisé),\nmais on peut atteindre une sorte d’orgasme mental\nsi les données sont nombreuses et le problème ardu.\n\n##### Inconvénients de la pensée en arborescence (p70)\n\nAu gré des branches de l’arbre, l’humeur change,\nil faut donc savoir observer sa pensée pour mieux la contrôler.\nExpression: «passer en pilotage manuel».\n\nLa force de l’imagination est telle que le virtuel est presque aussi\nintense que la réalité. Le plaisir s’use avant d’avoir été pris.\n\nParler seul permet de structurer le flot des idées.\n\n##### Des doutes et des questions à foison (p73)\n\nLe besoin de réassurance est infini, les objections sont pertinentes\n(anecdote Martini!!!).\n\nC’est positif jusqu’à un certain point (souplesse, modestie, tolérance,\nprudence, maturité), mais attention au monde mouvant.\n\nVoir *Psy de poche* pour les questions vie/mort/souffrance.\n\n##### Un va-et-vient constant entre passé, présent et futur (p75)\n\nLe temps est une des dimensions de l’arborescence,\nainsi que les effets collatéraux.\n\nNéanmoins la vie se vit au présent!\n\n##### Un moulin qui mouline (p78)\n\nMouliner utile est un bonheur avec du bon grain,\navoir 4 ou 5 projets de front est un plaisir.\nSinon c’est «l’anorexie (moi: bof) ou la malnutrition\nintellectuelle». Mais attentions aux pervers narcissiques,\nparticulièrement dangereux.\n\n##### Une mémoire capricieuse mais fabuleuse (p80)\nPeuvent se rappeler de détails insignifiants (en arbo auto),\nmais pas les informations importantes et ennuyeuses.\nLe cerveau se bloque si quelque chose de précis est\ndemandé, surtout sur la pression.\n\nApprendre et retenir, c’est le cœur qui décide (contenu\net enseignant). Les surefficients doivent se faire leurs\npropres moyens mnémotechniques et faire autre chose\nen même temps (TV, tchat, écouter de la musique, galipettes).\n\nPour retrouver l’information, souvent le doute gâche la\npremière idée.\n\n##### Le sommeil des surefficients mentaux\n\nLes nuits sont agitées car «la TV reste allumée. Les siestes\n«hypnotiques» (?) peuvent bien réparer en journée.\n\n##### Manque de sérotonine (p85)\nPistes pour apports:\n\n- protéïnes (baisse de sérotonine implique addiction au sucre)\n- sport\n- projets\n- relaxation (yoga, méditation…)\n\nÉvocation de griffonia et de l’homéopathie, mais surtout de la\nnécessité d’un avis médical car ça peut être génétique.\n\n#### Différentes formes de SM\n\n##### PESM (p88)\nAvec 7 catégories.\n\n##### Asperger (p90)\nAvec caractéristiques typiques et une tentative d’adaptation épuisante.\n\n#### Faut-il passer des tests de QI (p97)\n\nCritique sévère des tests. Classer, c’est très CG. Le CD refuse de\nclasser et d’étiqueter. \n\n# Partie 2\n\n## Chap 1 Le vide identitaire (p105)\n\nComment se faire une idée de qui on est si l’entourage\nn’y comprend rien? L’imagerie des SM dans l’IR et l’UV\nne peut pas être comprise par les autres.\n\nL’histoire de l’égo décrite p107 est un peu paradoxale.\n\n### L’estime de soi\n\nSi elle est bonne, on se lance dans des projets et on a\nune bonne défense contre les blessures d’amour propre.\nSinon c’est un cercle vicieux.\n\nSources d’estime de soi: la reconnaissance (par les parents\npuis par les amis) et les réussites. Mais les SM sont toujours\n«trop» quelque chose et n’obtiennent donc pas de reconnaissance.\nComme notre société est davantage attentive aux ratages\nqu’au reste et que le SM est perfectionniste, il ne valide\njamais de réussite.\n\n### La peur du rejet (p111)\n\nL’être humain est un animal social, s’ajuste pour ne pas être\nrejeté mais pas les SM qui ne comprennent pas. Ils ont peur\ndu rejet et de l’abandon, ses partenaires peuvent avoir\nun pouvoir exorbitant.\n\n### Stratégies d’adaptation (p112)\n\nCf Tony Atwood:\n\n- Autodévalorisation et déprime (intériorisation des moqueries\n  dans l’espoir de les conjurer, et retrait social)\n- Échappées dans le rêve (ou refuge dans un centre d’intérêt\n  exclusif (lecture, ciné, Internet pour évasion) mais risque d’addiction)\n- Arrogance («je suis bidon ou j’ai le melon» (cf Christophe André)\n  jusqu’à l’arrogance et la provocation, mais l’imposture a un prix\n- Imitation (en société, mais aussi imitateur de personnages pour\n  amuser les autres)\n\n### Le faux self (p119)\n\nIdentité: se sentir unique mais aussi intégré au groupe. Pour les SM,\nimpossible d’être soi et accepté. Si les sensations, émotions et\nsentiments sont bien expliqués, le «faux self» n’est qu’une fine\ncouche de politesses, bonnes manières, réserve, respect et\nbienveillance. Sinon le faux self asphyxie la vraie personnalité.\n\n#### Le salon d’accueil VIP (p122)\n\ntypo: gène -\u003e gêne\n\nImage du salon VIP organisé par le faux self vs le vrai moi\nbaillonné au fond du tunnel.

Cherche ce point\nd'extrême disponibilité en toi à partir duquel tu vas sentir le furtif bouger.\nN'essaie pas de pressentir, puisque c'est déjà anticiper sur ses mouvements\net il te déjouera aussi sec.

Je me souviens de tes leçons.\nEssaie de sentir à la vitesse du présent pur. Ni plus lentement, ni\nplus vite. En prise avec la durée. Repousse toute anticipation.

On va à sa rencontre.»\n– Tu peux le faire, Lorca, crois-moi!\n\n### Personne pour te donner un conseil\nTu étais le plus doué de ta promotion, Lorca. Personne ne s'en est\nrendu compte ici. Ni les formeurs, ni tes camarades. Même pas toi.\nTu deviendras un chasseur exceptionnel, c'est l'évidence et tu\nseras, comme tous les chasseurs exceptionnels, d'abord confronté à\nta propre folie. Accepte-le. Accepte-la.

Chez Zilch, ça signifiait approxima\ntivement ceci \u003e tu poses trop de questions, je perds du temps \u003e je hacke,\nmec, et t'es qu'un putain de boulet de notech \u003e alors agis et trace!\n1 cétait oui. 0 c'était non. J'adorais Zilch [...]\n\n### Banque mentale d'algos\nDans mes écouteurs, j'entends la grenaille des lignes de code que Zilch\ntape comme on mitraille. Ce qu'il fait demanderait plusieurs jours à un\npirate déjà chevronné. Mais lui a ses troyens et ses backdoors déjà ouvertes,\nson armée de botnets et une flopée de machines zombies activables àl'envi:\nil a son armurerie de softs à lui, accumulée sur dix ans, un trésor de guerre\nd'applis, de vers et de routines agressives qui percent les boucliers de sécurité par des failles minuscules et pénètrent les serveurs comme de l'acide;\nil a surtout sa banque de données mentale, caffie d'algorithmes qu'enrichit\nsans cesse son intelligence ultravive. Et pour finir, il carbure à la neuroïne,\nce qui coupe tout lag, toute pause: il déteste. Je ne suis même pas sûr, au\nmoment où je lui parle, qu'il ne travaille pas sur deux trois hacks à la fois\nen multitâche.\n\n### Rendement électoral\nL'avantage des polices commerciales demeure qu'elles sont payées à l'heure\net que la prime de risque associée aux missions nocturnes les rend vite coûteuses.\nMaintenir par conséquent une dizaine d'agents sur place, surtout\nen zone autonome, n'avait pas de sens, économiquement parlant, pour la\ngouvernance: beaucoup trop cher et sans rendement électoral. \n\n### Proférance et degrés de liberté\nJ'ai cette impression, fluctuante toutetois, de m'avancer un peu plus\nsolide, d'avoir progressé, oui, depuis neuf mois. Grâce à Miguel, à la faveur\naussi du temps qui délave et distancie la douleur. Ce matin, J'ai senti une\nadhérence différente, plus marquée (ou juste intriguée ?), plus embarquée\nen tout cas de mes élèves alors qu'il s'agit d'un quartier où je patine depuis\nde longs mois, où j'enseigne surtout pour honorer mon contrat avec ces\nparents qui n'ont pas les moyens de se payer l'école privée et qui se rabattent\nsur la proferrance. Non par choix idéologique: par dépit ou par défaut,\nplutot. Chaque semaine, j'essaie de leur prouver que notre pédagogie vaut,\net dépasse même de bcaucoup, celle du privé.\nQuandy'ai parlé des degrés de liberté aux adolescents, ces degrés que le numé-\nrique leur a fait perdre par rapport à leurs grands-parents anonymat des\néchanges, des courriers, des achats par exemple, liberté d'expression sans\ntrace ils ont commencé à mordre. Ça s'est senti aux regards, aux discussions parasites dans les travées, aux questions. Le sujet les touche, naturelle\nment, ils le vivent, ils sont nés dans ce monde bagué où le moindre de leur\nacte s'enregistre et informe un tiers de ce qu'ils sont et font. Mais j'étais\naussi plus habitée qu'à lordinaire, quand j'ai montré comment une histoire\nd'amour est aujourd'hui prise dans un filet de traces, est obligatoirement\nsue. Cam'a fait un bien fou de les sentir « tomber» dans le cours. Redes-\ncendre enfin là avec moi, sur ces gradins branlants qu'il faudrait vraiment\nchanger ne plus flotter dans l'ailleurs, àtripoter leur bague, à se vidéo-\nprojeter des sottises à l'encan. La mode cette année est d'utiliser le front\ncomme écran. Le front des autres évidemment, celui d'un brave gamin qui\nessaie d'écouter et ne se rend compte de rien (c'est plus drôle).\nChez cette génération, la tranche d'attention continue avoisine les trente\nsecondes. Elle était encore de deux minutes il y a dix ans. Par conséquent,\nchaque demi-minute exige de couper/relancer, sans cesse, par une question,\npar un jeu, par une photo, par une musique, faire réadhérer leur tête de\necture sur ma surface vocale.. Harassant en termes de rythme.\n\n### On sait donner la mort\n\nOn peut couper en deux un arbre qui a fait repousser ses bourgeons et ses\nfeuilles deux cent cinquante printemps de suite avec une tronçonneuse à\nessence et en huit minutes. On peut abattre un jaguar qui court à 90 km/h\ndans une savane en un dixième de seconde et avec une seule balle.\nQu'est-ce que ça prouve de nous? Qu'on sait stopper le mouvement?\nQu'à défaut d'être vivants, nous voudrions nous prouver qu'on sait donner la mort?\nJe voudrais rester dans ce Centre non pas vingt-quatre heures mais six mois.\nJuste à les écouter courir et pétiller, faire piailler la matière et la réinventer,\nse parler avec un langage que je finirais par deviner. Les écouter encore\nmétaboliser le bois et ramener sans cesse à la vie, en l'ingérant comme ils le\nfont, ce qu on a scié, émietté et recollé pour en faire des planches plates et\nde la paperasse de notre putain de race. Je voudrais contempler leur monde\navec mes oreilles en fleur aussi longtemps que je puisse - jusqu' à ce qu'y\npousse un fruit qui m'éveille et fasse enfin chair pour moi.\n\n### Sonore vs optique\n\n-Je ne crois pas ça dans l'absolu. Mais je crois ça pour les furtifs\ncarrément. Le sonore est un art de la durée. Donc du mouvement\net de l'émotion: c'est la même racine. Tu te fonds dans un flux, tu\nnages en pleine rivière. Tu accompagnes la métanmorphose progressive\ndes sons, tu les épouses. Tu deviens en même temps que ce que tu\nécoutes.L'optique par contre est un art de l'espace. A mes yeux. Ça\nconsiste à fixer et à figer le monde à l'instant t. On se tient dans le\nfroid, le spéculaire, la distance, la maîtrise. Et quand ça bouge, on\nest dans le contrôle. On checke des coordonnées, des trajectoires,\ndes vecteurs. L'optique relève pour moi du pouvoir.\n\n### Copains\n\n[...] eu la moindre histoire amoureuse avec quiconque. Saskia prit ma main et la\nlogea dans la sienne, sans bouger, sans aller plus loin. Et ça m'allait très bien.\n– Copains?\n– Copains.\n\n### Elle parle et elle écoute\n\nElle parle de surcroît très bien, avec un débit fluide et module, sans avoir\nde difficulté à trouver les mots justes - un talent qu' elle a aftiné durant une\ndécennie d'activisme dans l'écologie. Saskia jouit d'une authentique finesse\nde perception. L'écoute n'est pas juste une compétence, elle se retrouve chez\nelle au quotidien dans sa disponibilité aux êtres et aux contextes, sa façon de\nles recevoir et d'en discrinminer les enjeux, avant d'imposer quelque vision\nqu'elle ait. Cette écoute relève d'un habitus, elle est une façon de laisser le\nmonde des autres entrer chez elle quand tellement de gens s en méfient ou\ns'en défient. De là, elle tire naturellement une intelligence des situations,\ndont j'essaie souvent de m'inspirer: [...]\n\n### Retenir le temps\n– Non, du calendrier balinais, des cycles, des saisons. Kala dit que la\nconception d'un temps cyclique... que tout ce que les hommes font\npour qu'il soit cyclique... avec nos anniversaires, nos commémora-\nrions, nos horloges rondes, nos jours qui reviennent, nos années...\nTout ça n'est qu'un ettort prodigieux pour.. pour ne pas laisser le\ntemps passer.. Pour essayer qu'il ne s'en aille pas..\n– Le retenir?\n– Le balian lui répond que... oui... Que c'est aussi l'essence de la\nmusique et de la poésie... Que le rythme et la rime ont été inventés\npour tenir et retenir le temps... pour le ramener. Et donc pour\nqu' une mémoire des moments devienne possible.. Sans cette\nmémoire... aucun homme, animal, plante n'a de chance d'acquérir, d accumuler un savoir... d'apprendre à se construire... et donc\nde survivre.\n– Il dit vraiment tout ça?\n– Kala lui renvoie que la seule vraie beauté est dans l'instant qui ne\nreviendra jamais... Que ce qu'on conserve et répète s'affadit, s'avilit,\nse délave... Que maintenir n'est pas vivre... Vivre est créer.. Courir\nest vie, et danser sur la crête du « jamais-encore-vécu » - bon, la trad\ntait ce qu'elle peut... Le balian lui dit alors...\n\n### Amende proportionnelle\nToute intrusion ou dégradation est passible\nde trente-six mois de revenus et d'une peine [...]\n\n### Beauté crue\n\np234\nMême quand elle se veut sèche, elle n'arrive pas à se débarrasser de sa\ngrâce. Sa voix ne ferme jamais tout à fait, elle coule souple et claire, un\nruisseau. Ses yeux oscillent entre le vert et le jaune, à la façond'une tlamme\nvégétale. Parfois, ils virent vieil or, comme ici. Elle s'assoit sur le tapis sans\nrupture, je la sens tendue sans que sa nuque se décale ni que ses bras sac-\ncadent, elle prend juste une allure un peu plus hautaine de princesse arabe,\nson port est un peu plus droit, ses cheveux courts brilent ses joues d un\nblond un peu plus vénitien. Jamais je n'ai connu quelqu'un qui avait une\naussi faible conscience de sa beauté crue, une indifférence aussi cristalline\nà ce que son charme imprime malgré elle sur les gens. Seule la qualité de ce\nqu'elle dit et fait compte pour elle: le reste n'est qu'un effet collatéral de la\nnature, qu'elle cherche autant que possible à neutraliser par sa sobriété.\nm'a toujours beaucoup séduit.\n\n### Magie du quotidien\n\nMême quand le moineau repartait, nous attendions encore, je la soulevais\ndans mes bras, je l'enveloppais d'un pull, nous attendions que la cloche se\nbalance et sonne huit heures, ces huit coups que Tishka ne savait pas comp-\nter encore, si bien qu'elle m'écoutait, épatéc, les égrener, en chantonnant la\nmélodie de ma voix... cinq, six, sept, huit! Alors on refermait vite la fenêtre\npour filer dans la cuisine, Tishka devant, déjà éveillée et vive - « tu me\ncours?- faire chauffer le biberon, le poudrer de cacao, secouer, donner,\nblottir. La magie du quotidien.\n\n### La bague fluidifie\n\nÉvidemment. Je suis comme tout le monde en fait, ni plus ni moins\nC'est marrant, j'avais toujours refusé d'en avoir mais c'est fou ce que\nla bague te facilite la vie. J accède à tous les magasins maintenant,\ntous les services standard. Je prends le tram sans guetter les bocops.\nLes crochards m'évitent, je suis en *opt-out* de toute façon, par mon\nstatut de prisonnière. Tout était laborieux avant, il fallait redécliner\nSon identité pour chaque service, chaque zone. Là c'est fluide, je me\nsens presque intégrée, reconnue par les systèmes. Finalement ça me\nsoulage...\n\n### Pourquoi accepter\np277\n– Ils acceptent parce que nous rêvons tous d'un monde bienveillant,\nnrif à nous. Un monde qui prenne soin de nos esprits et de nos\ncorps stressés, qui nous protege et nous choie, nous aide et corrige nos\nerreurs, qui nous filtre l'environnement et ses dangers. Un monde qui\ns'efforce d'aménager un technococon pour notre bien-être. L'intelli-\ngence ambiante pourvoit à ça. Elle nous écoute et elle nous répond.\nElle courbe cette bulle autour de nos solitudes. Elle la tapisse d'objets et\nd'interfaces cools. Bien sûr, elle en protite pour nous espionner jusqu'au\nslip et pour nous manipuler jusqu'à la moelle! Mais au moins, elle s'oc-\ncupe de nous, ce que plus personne ne fait vraiment.. C'est un cercle\nvicieux. Plus nos rapports au monde sont intertacés, plus nos corps\nsont des îlots dans un océan de données et plus nos esprits éprouvent,\ninconsciemment, cette coupure, qu ils tentent de compenser. Et ils la\ncompensent en se reliant à des objets, en touchant et parlant à des dis-\npositifs qui nous rassurent - et nous distancent en même temps. Un\nreseau social est un tissu de solitudes reliées. Pas une communauté. Ce\nrauteuil que je caresse n'est pas un corps mais il me masse les reins. a\nme fait du bien donc ca me fait rêver d'un vrai corps que je n'aurai pas\ndonc je reviendrai au fauteuil, encore et encore...\n\n### Laissons passer\np283\nJe veux être au milieu d'une nature qui circule et qui flue, seigneur Varèse,\nqui passe son chemin et qui nous traverse. Les propriétés des nantis sont trop\nsouvent pensées comme des enclaves, conçues en termes de frontière et de coupure,\ncomme si le prestige d'un statut se décidait à l'épaisseur des protections.\nÀ titre personnel. Je crois que la noblesse se juge à leur finesse; la peur est toujours\nun signe de vulgarité. Je suis de passage, nous sommes tous de passage, alors\nLaissons les sangliers, les gens et le vent passer.\n\n### Gravé dans le marbre\ntemps s'apprivoise. lci le papier serait trop iragile, trahirait ce que je me suis\ntoujours dit de nos littératures, à savoir que sil'on y croyait vraiment, sil'on\npensait que nos phrases sont des choses vitales, on ne les imprimerait pas\nsur des feuilles qui se trouent à la moindre goutte d'cau et que la plus petite\ncolere déchire: on ferait comme les disciples d' Epicure, on les graverait en\nlettres de colosse sur la plus rêche des surfaces durables, à coups de burin\nsur le roc têtu d'une falaise, au moins d'un mur, pour signer dans la masse\nla motricité marcescible d'une syntaxe.\n\n### Être sonore\np332\nL'enjeu reste simple au fond: il est que le son reste en vie.\nÀ chaque fraction de seconde. Un frisson qui ne fluctue pas continuellement\nest un son mort, il n'est plus musical. Un son fixe, régulier, identique\ncomme l'est un bip ou un moteur, est un *objet sonore* tandis qu'un\nson musical est un *être sonore*. Un être qui naît et grandit, évolue\npuis meurt, avec élégance, furie, parfois d'une crise subite - pour\nmieux renaître ailleurs, plus tard. Un chef-d'œuvre musical comme\nl'est le frisson n'est pas une expo d'objets, Louise, un musée de tons\nou de syllabes à reproduire. C'est un spectacle vivant acoustique où \nles sons sont des comédiennes qui incarnent, s'affrontent ou s'aiment\nréagissent l'une envers l'autre dans l'écart ou la fusion, seconde après\nseconde après seconde. Si vos furtives fuient, ce n'est pas qu'elles\ncraignent d'être sloquées, c'est que vous leur proposez du son mort.\n\n### Enfant qu'on était\n\np380\n– Audioquides touristiques – Errance assistée – Cette sorcellerie oubliée.\nCette magie qui s'enfuit. Et que l'enfant qu'on a fait redonne à l'enfant\nqu'on était, sans le vouloir. Juste en étant ce qu'il est et que nous, les parents\ncoagulés, on n'aurait jamais dû cesser d'être.\n\n### Habiter \n\np384\n– et c'est là toute leur puissance: aimer se cacher, se nicher, faire terrier\naménager loin des prédateurs et près des ressources, retrouver une liberté\ndont la structure même de la ville a fait son lit et son tombeau. Se rappeler\nqu'habiter est la première capacité des vivants.\n\n### Le vivant\n\np595\nLe vivant dans sa totipotence, oui, dans toute sa fluidité, ses bruissements\net son intensité, telle était Tishka. Le vivant dans sa résilience, dans son\nautopoïèse proprement miraculeuse, cette autocréation de soi qu'elle avait\nau plus haut point et qu'elle puisait dans l'environnement pour le métaboliser,\ns'en nourrir comme personne. Le vivant comme système ouvert plus\nque tout, en équilibre instable, qui conjure sans cesse l'entropie et s'offre sa\npropre liberté chaque jour. C'est tout ça que Tishka avait d'instinct été chercher\nchez les furtifs, du cœur de sa pulsion enfantine, c'était ça qui l'avait\narrachée à nous, à son cocon, à notre contort de parents couvants. Quand je\nla regarde devant moi, figée, je ne me sens pas coupable de l'avoir regardée.\nje me sens furieuse de n'avoir pas su la maintenir libre. De ne pas lui avoir\ndit « nous sommes ton piège, chaton. Ton amour pour nous sera un jour ou\nl'autre ton piège. Pars, fuis quand tu sentiras la glu coller tes pieds, déploie\ntoi». Et maintenant, elle est là: une statue. Et nous prions d'avoir assez de\ngénie en nous pour la libérer de la mort.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T20:49:25.510550845Z","tags":[]},"/Listes-de-nombres":{"title":"Listes de nombres","content":"#classe/NSI #peda/activite #info/lang/python\n\n# Listes de nombres\n1.

À part les\narythmiques, on reste le plus souvent à un facteur 2 ou 3 près de ses camarades\n(« half-time » ou « double-time »).\n\nSolfège : la pulsation est le plus souvent notée par une noire (𝅘𝅥 ), mais peut\nl’être :\n\n* par une croche (𝅘𝅥𝅮 ),\n* ou une blanche (𝅗𝅥 ) et se note ¢ « C barré ».\n\nVoyons les bases (mesures et subdivisions) pour ensuite les\n[[#Bases comprises|combiner]].\n\n### Bases\n\n#### Mesures\n\nUne *mesure* est un groupe de pulsations et contient le plus souvent 4 ou 3\npulsations (ou *temps*), mais aussi parfois 6, 2, 5, 7…\n\nDans la musique « qu’on entend à la radio », les mesures comportent très très\nsouvent 4 pulsations et le motif classique de batterie est « poum tchac poum\ntchac », avec un son par pulsation.\n\nLes mesures sont regroupées en *lignes*, le plus souvent de 4 mesures, mais\naussi de 2, 3 ou 5 mesures. Il existe des façons de compter les pulsations et\nles mesures à la fois : « un (deux, trois, quatre), deux (deux, trois, quatre),\ntrois (deux, trois, quatre)… ».\n\nLes lignes sont regroupées en *sections* (introduction, couplet, pré-refrain,\nrefrain, pont, outro…).\n\n#### Subdivisions\n\nLes pulsations peuvent être partagées en durées égales, le plus souvent 2, 4\nou 3, parfois jusqu’à 6, 8 ou 16 et plus rarement 5 (solfège + notation Gra).\nAttention, certaines musiques chaloupantes ne subdivisent pas en parties égales.\n\nIllustration : arbre des subdivisions\n\nTriolets, quartolets, quintolets…\n\nIl existe des façons de prononcer les subdivisions pour se repérer dans la\nmesure et les subdivisions :\n\n* un et, deux et, trois et…\n* un-olet, deux-olet, trois-olet…\n* one-e-and-a, two-e-and-a, three-e-and-a…\n\nExo : choisir une subdivision et en jouer toutes les notes, puis essayer toutes\nles combinaisons. Cela peut se faire :\n\n* avec claps,\n* main droite et gauche (MD-MG), avec ou sans baguettes (voir rudiments),\n* sur son instrument (aller-retour avec la MD de la guitare par exemple,\n  ou avec les doigts de la MD de la basse),\n* avec la voix.\n\nLes phrases musicales ont un « débit » : la plus grande subdivision qui peut\nles porter.\n\nBon exo : passer d’une subdivision à une autre (en jouant toutes les\nnotes) surtout d’une binaire à une ternaire (ou inversement). On peut aussi\njouer un rythme plus lent que la pulsation, un peu comme si la subdivision\nétait strictement inférieure à 1.\n\nLe *swing feel* est la notation par deux croches des croches extrêmes d’un\ntriolet (solfège).\n\n### Bases comprises\n\nAprès les mesures et les subdivisions :\n\n* dans 4 noires jouer 3 croches (noires pointées), puis 3 doubles croches\n  (croches pointées)\n   * en résolvant à la fin de la mesure pour retomber sur le 1\n   * en avançant la résolution dans la mesure\n   * en ne résolvant pas (mais sur six noires, ça résout)\n* ostinatos, claves…\n* trouver des exemples de morceaux pour chaque combinaison de mesure et\n  subdivision (4:4, 12:8, 9:8…), noter des rythmes de ces morceaux\n* indépendance des membres et/ou instrument (y compris la voix)\n* difficile : chanter un ostinato et claper une mélodie rythmique\n\nIdées pour travailler :\n\n* métronome\n* 224 (tatata, tatata, tatatatatatata)\n* ou 2248…\n\n## Notes\n\nOn part de ce postulat : on a douze notes par octave.
