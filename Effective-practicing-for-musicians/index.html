creep into your practice time and create a diversion. Set aside separate
time for playing, preferably after the practice session.</li><li>Record a practice session. The purpose here is not to record an exercise,
but to record how you are practicing. Schedule at least an hour for
your session, choose one or two things (not more) that youd like to
focus on before you start, and then set a timer and work on them
exclusively for 20 minutes. Afterwards, just play for as long as you
want, having the most fun with the least amount of pressure possible.</li><li>Experience how it feels to do just what you set out to do, secure in the
knowledge that youll still have enough time to do whatever you want
to do later on. Did the practicing feel different? If yes, how so? Was
the playing more enjoyable?</li><li>Did you find that you could have outlined more clearly exactly what
you wanted to practice?</li><li>Did you feel a heightened sense of focus and productivity from the
awareness that you were being recorded?</li><li>Listen back to the recording and see how you did. Write down what
you find out and save these notes for later.</li></ul><a href=#environment><h4 id=environment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Environment</h4></a><ul><li>Your environment infuences the likelihood of whether you will
practice or not.</li><li>Visualize your ultimate practice space.</li><li>Get out a pen and paper and use the brainstorming method: Write
down anything and everything that comes to mind, allowing yourself
to dream big without criticizing or deleting.</li><li>Go through your wish list and make as many improvements as
possible-maybe choose the 3 things that would make the biggest
difference right away.</li><li>Size up your instrument and the environment around it; try to ix
whatever is missing.</li><li>Think about your process. Can you optimize your commute or any
rituals before and after? This could mean something big, like finding a
new practice space or replacing a smelly rug, or something small, like
simply treating yourself to a coffee after each practice session.</li><li>Make this space your own. Make it fun and do it now!</li></ul><a href=#practicing-anywhere><h4 id=practicing-anywhere><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Practicing anywhere</h4></a><ul><li>Consider the three parameters of size, volume, and portability, and
how they apply to vour instrument. Recognize how they might pose
limitations to your practice time.</li><li>Research alternatives and brainstorm about ways to change these
parameters or even free yourself from these limitations.</li><li>Review the settings in your daily routine and think about how
you could transtorm them into new practice environments. Look
at traveling and waiting times, your living space, your workplace,
vacation stays, and so on.</li><li>Set up a satellite or stripped-down practice area in your home,
especially if you are used to practicing in a separate rehearsal space.
Could you squeeze in some practice time while someone else takes a
nap?</li><li>Develop an appreciation for these alternative practice setups and
the advantages they offer. For instance, I made a list of the places and
daytimes I can practice with a pad where I couldn&rsquo;t with a real drum set.</li><li>Lastly, brainstorm about ways to gain access to a real instrument that
you havent thought of before. Some people conclude too easily that
they have to live with a stripped-down version all the time. Could
you ask a friend, music school, community center, or church about
spending time with a real piano or drum set one night a week or once
a month? Ask around-you might be surprised to find your efforts
rewarded.</li></ul><a href=#practicing-without-your-instrument><h4 id=practicing-without-your-instrument><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Practicing without your instrument</h4></a><ul><li>Remember that some exercises can help improve your playing and
don&rsquo;t require you to have an instrument in your hands at all.</li><li>Come up with a list of all the ways you could practice without your
instrument. Note this isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; scenario; some things you&rsquo;ve
practiced exclusively on your instrument so far can show up here as
well.</li><li>Choose one song you are working on and take a few complete passes
only in your head. Then play it on your instrument and see if there&rsquo;s
been any improvement.</li><li>Be resourceful! Download a metronome app like Gap Click by Benny
Greb, which will help improve yourability to keep tempo and heighten
your awareness of subdivision, whether youre with or without your
instrument.</li></ul><a href=#a-different-look-at-discipline><h4 id=a-different-look-at-discipline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>A different look at discipline</h4></a><ul><li>Realize that self-discipline is your friend that serves you, that works
for you.</li><li>Self-discipline is freedom, because it gets you where you want to be.</li><li>In order for this friend to help you, you absolutely have to become
crystal clear about what you want and why you want it. This is what
gives your everyday actions purpose, and helps you remember that the
challenge is worth it, even when the journey gets tough.</li><li>Make the important choice to be loyal to your future, not your past.</li></ul><p>As soon as you become clear about what you want and can consistently
demonstrate your progress towards this goal, you will find out that you
have more discipline than you think. Many musicians think they lack
discipline, when all they need is a more disciplined approach.</p><a href=#motivation><h4 id=motivation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Motivation</h4></a><ul><li>Write down at least things that you once wished, aspired to
hoped for, that you achieved and now maybe even take for granted
Remember vividly how much you wanted this. Was it being able
to play a certain piece of music: Attaining a certain piece of
Collaborating with a mentor? Getting together with someone or
moving to a new place? Whatever it may be, focus on the things su you
wished tor, wanted to come true, and then made happen.</li><li>For each goal you&rsquo;ve identified, write down the steps that por vo
there, or in other words, what worked? Then draw a line, and also
write down what didn&rsquo;t work, the efforts you considered a waste of
time that later proved to have helped, and anything else that comes to
mind. Write it all down and analyze.</li><li>The point here is that youre not starting from scratch; you can learn
from your evperiences. You&rsquo;ve already made things happen, and it&rsquo;s
Yes, we learn from our istakes, as they say-but don&rsquo;t forget to learn
mnottant to understand what worked and repeat those behaviors.
from your successes, too.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t just get busy for the sake of being busy. Find out what you want
and why you want it. What is the reason that makes it worthwhile
to put in your time and effort? And does this reason really mean
something to you?</li><li>Choose the process that&rsquo;s most likely to get you where you want to
go. Is this the right exercise for what I want to improve? Is this exactly
what I should be focusing on? Since we can&rsquo;t predict the future, it&rsquo;s
OK that this can only ever be a best guess, but make sure it is directly
connected to the reason why you are practicing. Your why should help
you determine this.</li><li>When you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, find out where the error is. Remember
it can be one of two things: 1) Is your why not clear enough? or 2) Are
you not confident that the merhod you chose is the right one? Dont
nange your goal if it&rsquo;s merely your approach that needs changings</li><li>Measure your progress regularly. Don&rsquo;t rely on your intuition here.
Use recordings and journaling to compare where you are now to
where you started.</li></ul><a href=#attitude><h4 id=attitude><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Attitude</h4></a><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t be a perfectionist; strive every day to &ldquo;do the best you can with
what you have right now. If you add in some planning and long-term
perspective, I believe this is a grounded approach that will serve you
not only when it comes to practicing, but in all aspects from business
to family life.</li><li>Practice like it matters, because it does. This can be as easy as reminding
yourself not to fall into the &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter trap&rdquo; and making a
conscious decision to be more mindful. Record yourself often, and
enjoy the heightened focus that comes with getting into &ldquo;performance
mode&rdquo;. Keep in mind that the way you practice definitely shapes the
way you will pertorm and, whať&rsquo;s more, it can even help make your
pertormance way more fun.</li><li>Cultivate gratitude in your life. For example, for the past few years,
part of my morning ritual has been to ask, &ldquo;What are the three things
l am grateful for today?&rdquo; My family started to adopt this as well, so we
sit down to breakfast and tell each other. You can also write them down
in a journal. What comes to mind? Is it having good health, safety,
opportunity, and love in your life? Maybe you can even be gratetul
for the challenges you have right now, since you could certainly have
different ones.</li><li>Spread gratitude regularly. Leave a voice message for a good friend or
call up a family member just to let them know you&rsquo;re grateful to have
them in your life. It&rsquo;s so damn simple, yet can have such a massive
impact. Cmon - try it right now.</li><li>Remember that even what may seem like the most stupid and useless
tasks can give you beautiful experiences and lessons, not to mention
unexpected results, when you do them really well. Great questions to
ask vourself here are: How can I do this well? How can I make this fun
while still respecting the task? How else can I get the job done? and
lastly, How can I do this with greater calm and focus?</li></ul><a href=#i-dont-have-enough-time><h4 id=i-dont-have-enough-time><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>I don&rsquo;t have enough time</h4></a><ul><li><strong>Set timer/take notes.</strong> Decide how and where you want to take notes. It
may be most practical to use a smartphone as your timer and a notepad
app as your journal, but really, any kind of timer and notebook will do.
The critical factor here is this: You absolutely have to have them with you
at all times. Trust me, otherwise it wont work. You&rsquo;ll probably find the
most game-changing realizations in situations that seem like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll
remember this&rdquo; or &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t carry much weight.&rdquo; No you won&rsquo;t, and
Yes it does! Dont trust your memory - write it all down!</li><li><strong>Dont freak out! Just observe.</strong> Set the timer and take notes - this is really
all vou have to do. Just do it. Don&rsquo;t try to make it perfect. No need to
beat yourself up. Maybe for the first time in your life you&rsquo;re gaining some
insight as to where your time actually goes, and this is good. You don&rsquo;t
have to change anything just yet, simply be a neutral observer. Use any
tool you can to help reconstruct your day as accurately as possible: your
calendar, your browser history - heck, these days your phone can tell you
exactly how many minutes you spent on a call. Write it all down.</li><li><strong>Do this for 10 days.</strong> Even though after two days you might be thinking
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! I know what to do!&rdquo; and are eager to get started on your new
routine, please keep this going for a full 10 days. Why? Because 10 days
is more than one week, so you&rsquo;ll have at least a full week to observe and
an identify patterns that may be repeated at the beginning of the second
week. Time-logging can help us pinpoint the trivial activities you can stop
doing, but more importantly the activity patterns, or in other words, the
things you do regularly. The biggest improvements are likely to come from
changing patterns, not isolated activities. So do it for 10 days.</li></ul><a href=#how-often-should-i-practice><h4 id=how-often-should-i-practice><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How often should I practice</h4></a><ul><li>If you only do it once in a while, dont be mad if you only see results
once in a while.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t worry that a bad practice session or a bad day will mess up
everything. By the same token, don&rsquo;t get overexcited if you&rsquo;re lucky and
something comes out right for once. Test the reliability of your output,
and get used to making a little bit of progress consistently. This will have
a larger impact than a long weekend of killing yourself, especially if it&rsquo;s a
one-off. Consistency is key.</li><li>Remember the examples of the tuning challenge and the archery
lesson. A tiny shift in habit and direction now will make a tremendous
impact in the long run.</li><li>What tiny shift in your daily life could you make? What kind of shift
would serve you on your instrument? Whatever comes to mind here,
start now and keep it consistent.</li><li>Consciously leverage the dramatic long-term effects of habits, routines,
and rituals, for they will shape your future more than isolated incidents.</li></ul><a href=#when-is-the-best-time-to-practice><h4 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-practice><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>When is the best time to practice</h4></a><ul><li>There are many benefits to having regular practice times. Willpower
doesn&rsquo;t last, but a ritual can last a lifetime.</li><li>Think about what you can do to incorporate practicing in a such way
that it becomes an &ldquo;of course&rdquo; thing for you.</li><li>See if you can attach your practice time to another part of your usual
routine, like before rehearsal, after work, or before going to the gym.</li><li>Experiment to find your sweet spots - find out what type you are.
What feels better: to wake up early and practice betore everything else
gets going, or are you a night owl? You have the luxury of making your
own personal choice here, but don&rsquo;t get hung up on it. Honor your
preference, but don&rsquo;t use it as an excuse.</li><li>If you catch yourself overthinking it, remember the down-to-earth
wisdom of the fitness trainer and just practice whenever you can
Eighty percent of success is just showing up.</li></ul><a href=#distractionfocus><h4 id=distractionfocus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Distraction/focus</h4></a><ul><li><strong>Make sure you are clear!</strong> Remember that in order to stay on track,
there has to be one. Do you know specifically what you want to do in
this practice session? The more narrowly you define this, the easier it
will be to stick to it.</li><li><strong>Communicate with yourself and others.</strong> Take the time to manage
expectations and revise commitments to yourself and others. Of
course, the more ritualized and consistent your practice time is, the
less negotiation will be required and less resistance will crop up.</li><li><strong>Leave your luggage at the door.</strong> Place a little notebook near your
instrument or outside the door to your practice room. Make it a ritual
to do a brain dump of whatever is on your mind that you don&rsquo;t want
to forget but won&rsquo;t need while practicing. Write it all down, and then
place it in front of the door where you won&rsquo;t forget it on your way out.</li><li><strong>Minimize potential input.</strong> One of the most eftective ways to deal
with interruptions is to prevent them. Switch off the internet, your
phone, any notifications and incoming messages of any kind. Can
you disable the doorbell? Is there unfinished business in the room that
grabs your attention? Get rid of it!</li></ul><a href=#the-3-must-have-tools-for-practicing><h4 id=the-3-must-have-tools-for-practicing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The 3 must have tools for practicing</h4></a><p>Timer, recording device, journal.

whom you are trying to help. Operate in reality; see your playing for
what it is, but also no worse than it is. Next time you listen to a
recording of yourself, start by writing down three things you like about
it. If you&rsquo;re struggling, make this an exercise in itself and try rephrasing
it this way: &ldquo;If I had to like any three things about this, what would
they be?&rdquo; Only then are you allowed to move on to writing down three
things you&rsquo;d like to improve.<br>Note that language is really important here. Dont seize upon three
things that you hate, don&rsquo;t like, or always suck. Choose three things
that you want to improve or could execute better. I do this myself
and have suggested this exercise to many students of mine, including
kids who are having difficulty and especially teenagers. Become good
at being kind to yourself and taking a more objective view of your
output.</p></li><li><p>Measure your own progress - don&rsquo;t compare your journey to what you
assume to be true about anyone else. Make recordings of your practice
sessions and compare them to each other. Acknowledge not just the
completion of a major project or challenging thing you are working
on, but also the smallest of incremental changes and take a moment
to celebrate them consciously.</p></li><li><p>Use the &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; and &ldquo;relax, refocus&rdquo; mantras. At your next
practice session, pay particular attention to your self-talk and how
you react when frustration or impatience comes up. Try saying the
&ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; mantra out loud and, if you want, add a smile. Problems
hate it when you talke a moment to breathe and then smile at them.</p></li></ul><a href=#the-checklist-cycle><h4 id=the-checklist-cycle><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The checklist cycle</h4></a><p>BODY</p><ul><li>Can I sit more upright?</li><li>Are my shoulders back and down?</li><li>Are my elbows out? Can I let them hang loosely while I&rsquo;m doing what
I&rsquo;m doing?</li><li>Is there any unnecessary tension in my face, neck, shoulders, arms
back, legs, or hands?</li></ul><p>TECHNIQUE</p><ul><li>How much more relaxed can I play this?</li><li>Can I use less motion? Or as I like to think of it: Can I use a smaller
gear? This means, am I using my whole arm for this motion when I
can manage it with my just forearm, wrist, or fingers? For my feet, can
I rest my foot on the ground when iť&rsquo;s not in use?</li></ul><p>SOUND</p><ul><li>Am I playing too loud?</li><li>Are the notes that should be at the same volume level sounding tne
same?</li><li>Can it be more even?</li><li>Are the accents distinguishable from the nonaccented notes</li></ul><p>TIME</p><ul><li>Can I sing/feel the quarter-note pulse over what I&rsquo;m playing?</li><li>Is the subdivision even? Does it flow?</li><li>Can I sing a half-time groove over this?</li></ul><p>How to use this list?</p><ul><li>Start with my checklist and apply it to whatever you&rsquo;re working on
at the moment. Write it down or make a copy, and then position
it where you can take a peek without having to stop playing. One
student shared that he uses a timer to prompt himself to move on to
the next item; whatever works for you. I&rsquo;m confident you will start to
see ultraquick improvements in your practicing.</li><li>As soon as you&rsquo;ve gotten the hang of it, don&rsquo;t stop there. Please modify
and customize the checklist to fit your needs, whether this means
adding something that feels missing or crossing something out. Make
it yours and use it.</li></ul><a href=#how-to-tackle-big-things-by-making-them-small><h4 id=how-to-tackle-big-things-by-making-them-small><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How to tackle big things by making them small</h4></a><ul><li>Try out both variations on the whale method, salami slice and
sandwich, and use these next bullet points as your quick guide.</li><li>Take a challenging phrase you want to work on, set its lenght as the
loop, start a metronome, and get a feel for the form.</li><li>Focus only on the first note and try to get it right; after that, relax until
its your turn again.</li><li>Whatever you&rsquo;ve built up must feel good before you&rsquo;re allowed to add
the next note.</li><li>Dont get impatient. Only add one new note at a time.</li><li>Whenever you get overwhelmed and have trouble adding the next
note, go back to the version before, which you can handle without
sacrificing tempo, form, sound quality, and relaxation.</li><li>Whatever happens, keep the form.</li></ul><a href=#what-to-practice><h4 id=what-to-practice><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What to practice?</h4></a><ul><li>First of all, relax and realize that not everything is equally important
and urgent. In fact, most things dont really matter, or at least don&rsquo;t
matter right now. lt&rsquo;s OK to not give them your energy in the form of
your thoughts and attention. When you do this, you&rsquo;ll be blown away
by how much energy you have left for the things that do matter.</li><li>Get comfortable with the fact that in order to progress in one area,
you will probably end up neglecting another. That&rsquo;s OK. That&rsquo;s what
a decision means. The word <em>decision</em> comes from the Latin word
<em>decidere</em>, &ldquo;to cut off.&rdquo;</li><li>When we set up your personal EPM system, we will find out exactly
where you want to go in relation to where you are right now. And
this will give us a very clear understanding about what the next step
is - or for our purposes, <em>what</em> to practice - using the same reasoning
process that helps you decide what to have for breakfast, and allows
you to advise a pedestrian on the street which direction to take once
you know the destination.</li></ul><hr><p class=meta>Last updated
