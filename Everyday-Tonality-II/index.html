vibrations producing it —its acoustic FREQUENCY. Frequency is measured in
Hertz (abbr. HZ).</li><li>TONE means a note with discernible fundamental pitch and TONAL is its
adjective.</li><li>TONAL means having the properties of a tone. Notes can be tonal or non‐tonal.</li><li>TONALITY is an abstract noun denoting the state or quality of being TONAL
(§4, above). More specifically, TONALITY means a system according to which
tones are configured.</li><li>TONALITY includes such phenomena as KEY (Tonart), MODE (Chapters 3‐4),
MELODY (Chapter 5), TONAL POLYPHONY (Chap‐ ter 6), CHORDS and HARMONY
(Chapters 7‐15). It also includes certain aspects of TIMBRE
(§§11‐14, below).</li><li>TONIC is a noun meaning keynote or reference tone for a piece or passage of
music. Its adjective is TONICAL.</li><li>TONICAL qualifies music that has a tonic.</li><li>TONICALITY is the abstract noun derived from TONICAL. It means the state or
quality of having a tonic.</li><li>Music without a tonic is NON‐TONICAL (or atonical). Music without tones
is non‐tonal (or atonal). Twelve‐tone music is non‐ tonical (or atonical).
It is certainly not atonal.</li><li>TIMBRE (a.k.a. ‘tone quality’ or ‘tone colour’) is a complex acoustic
phenomenon allowing us to distinguish between two notes, tonal or
otherwise, sounded at the same pitch and volume. Its adjective is TIMBRAL.</li><li>TIMBRE consists of an ENVELOPE containing four elements: ATTACK, DECAY,
SUSTAIN and RELEASE.</li><li>DECAY and SUSTAIN are the most readily extendable elements of timbre and
can be referred to collectively as the CONTINUANT. A tone’s CONTINUANT
consists of a FUNDAMENTAL PITCH and of PARTIALS or HARMONICS pitched at
integral multiples of the fundamental’s own frequency.</li><li>How strongly which HARMONICS are present in which parts of an envelope is
an essential factor defining a particular timbre.</li><li>MODES are by definition TONAL. The widely disseminated binary
TONALITY / MODALITY is a conceptual aberration.</li></ol><a href=#subjects><h3 id=subjects><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Note, pitch, tone 45</li><li>Note 45</li><li>Pitch 47</li><li>Tonal note names 49</li><li>Tone, tonal, tonality 51</li><li>‘Tonal’ and ‘tonical’ 52</li><li>‘Tonal’ and ‘modal’ 54</li><li>Tonality, Tonart, Tonalité, Tonicity, Tonicality 56</li><li>Other meanings of ‘tone’ 58</li><li>Timbre and tone 58</li><li>Summary in 15 points + bridge 63</li></ul><a href=#chapter-2><h2 id=chapter-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-14-points><h3 id=summary-in-14-points><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 14 points</h3></a><ol><li>EXTRA‐OCTAVE TUNING exists basically to ensure that all participants in a
musical event perform any given note at the same pitch. CONCERT PITCH
(A4=440 Hz) was established as international standard to facilitate such
tuning. ABSOLUTE (OR PERFECT) PITCH is a side effect of this
standardisation.</li><li>INTRA‐OCTAVE TUNING regulates intervals (see §9) between the octave’s
(see §3) constituent pitches so that they are sounded in a consistent fashion.</li><li>In most Western music the OCTAVE is treated heptatonically, in the sense
that it very often consists of seven basic steps (doh ré mi fa sol la ti).
The OCTAVE is so called because it is the eighth note you arrive at if you
ascend one heptatonic step at a time (doh ré mi fa sol la ti |doh|).</li><li>If doh is TONIC and numbered 1, the other six SCALE DEGREES are numbered
2 3 4 5 6 7.</li><li>Five of the standard Western heptatonic OCTAVE’S STEPS are WHOLE TONES;
the other two are both SEMITONES.</li><li>The standard Western OCTAVE is also divided into TWELVE SEMITONES to cater
for varying placement of tone‐ and semitone steps in different modes.
SEMITONAL VARIANTS precede their relevant SCALE DEGREES,
e.g. b3 as the minor third and M3 as the major third scale degree.</li><li>NOTE NAMES are identical for pitches separated by an octave. The pitch
frequency difference factor between two such notes is 2,
e.g. A3=220 Hz, A4=440 Hz, A5=880 Hz.</li><li>The OCTAVE is a useful unit when referring to REGISTER. A standard piano keyboard covers a range of pitches from 29.135 (A0) to 8,416 Hz (C8), equivalent to 7¼ octaves. The average human singing voice spans about two octaves.</li><li>An INTERVAL is the difference in pitch between two tones. Even if
intervals can be measured in Hz, they are most often designated in terms of
scale degree difference. In this way the interval between 1 and 4
(e.g. a and d ««in A»») as well as between 4 and 7 (d and g) is a fourth
(roman counting: (x+1)‐y=z).</li><li>Conventional SCALE DEGREE NAMES like dominant and subdominant are useful in
theories of euroclassical tonality but are irrelevant or misleading when
dealing with most other types of tonality. The equation of LEADING NOTE with
scale degree 7 (7 = b7 or M7) is particularly problematic.</li><li>‘NATURAL INTERVALS’ are characterised by simple frequency ratios
expressing pitch difference, e.g. 3:2 for the perfect fifth. Tuning based
on such intervals is often called JUST‐TONE TUNING and is often heard as
clearer and brighter than EQUAL‐TONE TUNING. However, while G# and Ab are
pitched identically in equal‐tone tuning, they can be seriously out of tune
with one another when treated as natural intervals.</li><li>To avoid the problem of ‘G#≠Ab’, EQUAL‐TONE TUNING adjusts each of the
octaveʹs twelve constituent semitones so that each semitone step is
intervallically identical. An equal‐tone semitone interval is measured as
100 cents.</li><li>Many music cultures configure the octaveʹs constituent pitches in ways
that do not conform to the twelve semitone pitches of Western tunings.

individual occurrences of its constituent tones. These are normally arranged
in ascending scalar order and delimited by scale degree 1 (1, the tonic)
at the bottom and top of one octave.</li><li>Many traditions of musical learning conceive of the OCTAVE as consisting of
SEVEN BASIC SCALE DEGREES, several of which (typically 3 6 and 7, but also
2 and 4) are variable in pitch.</li><li>The distinctive character of a mode is largely determined by its
UNIQUE SCALE DEGREE PROFILE, e.g. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (ionian),
? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? (Hijaz). Even so, music in the same mode can vary quite
substantially in mood and character depending on which of its constituent
tones are used in which way, as well as on other musical factors
(see ‘Aeolian’, pp. 105‐112).</li><li>SIX HEPTATONIC DIATONIC MODES are in common use in the West:
ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian and aeolian.
These six modes all contain a PERFECT FIFTH and consist of four scalar steps
of a whole tone and two of one semitone. The locrian is less common, except
in heavy metal music.</li><li>The IONIAN, LYDIAN and MIXOLYDIAN are called ‘MAJOR’ modes because they
contain ??, the DORIAN, PHRYGIAN and AEOLIAN are called ‘MINOR’ because of
their ??. The notion that major modes are happy and minor modes sad is
questionable.</li><li>The IONIAN mode has equivalents in many music cultures but no pride of place
among other modes in those traditions.</li><li>A vast number of heptatonic modes exist in addition to the six or seven
more familiar to Westerners. Many of those other heptatonic modes are
non‐diatonic. Nineteen Greek dromoi and at least thirty Arab maqamat are in
daily use.</li><li>Many modes in the ARAB and OTTOMAN traditions contain pitches
incompatible with Western tuning systems, e.g. e§, ¾‐tone above ?,
¼‐tone below ?? and ¾‐tone below ?.</li><li>A MAQAM octave is often theorised as a combination of two TETRACHORDS.
This aspect of tonal theory is useful in the understand‐ ing of many types
of mode.</li><li>Modes containing ?? or ?? and/or a scale step of an augmented second
(1½ tones), as in the ‘harmonic minor’ —NAHAWAND— and HIJAZ, are very common
in the Arab world, the Balkans, Greece and Turkey. HIJAZ is also common in
ANDALUSIA as one of fla‐ menco music’s two mi modes.</li><li>The AUGMENTED SECOND interval (1½ tones) and the scale de‐ gree FLAT TWO
(??) have been used in the West as stereotypical sig‐ nals of a remarkably
wide variety of ethnic ‘Others’, most notably Arabs, Jews and Gypsies,
the latter from both the Balkans and southern Spain.</li><li>The PHRYGIAN is the only diatonic heptatonic mode to include FLAT TWO (??),
and the HARMONIC MINOR the only euroclassical mode to contain an AUGMENTED
SECOND.</li><li>The LYDIAN FLAT SEVEN mode, found in traditional music from ROMANIA, and as
used by BARTÓK, has tonal similarities to blues modes. It is also
characteristic of music from Northeastern BRAZIL.</li><li>‘Phrygian dominant’ and ‘lydian dominant’ are patent MISNO‐ MERS.
Westerners raised on a tonal diet of V-I in the ionian mode and who fail to
hear a final cadence in the phrygian or Hijaz modes are effectively deaf to
the PHRYGIAN TONIC. Similarly, music in the lydian flat seven mode cannot
morph into another mode with another tonic by being that tonic’s
‘dominant’ without the music ceasing to be in lydian flat seven.</li></ol><a href=#subjects-2><h3 id=subjects-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Heptatonic modes 85</li><li>Intro 85</li><li>Scales, modes, tonal vocabulary 87</li><li>Ionianisation (??) 90</li><li>Modes and ‘modality’ 92</li><li>Heptatonic: why seven? 93</li><li>The heptatonic‐diatonic ‘church’ modes 94</li><li>Theory 94</li><li>Examples 99</li><li>Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian Mixolydian Aeolian: 99 to 105</li><li>Non‐diatonic heptatonic modes 112</li><li>Maqamat, flat twos and foreignness 114</li><li>Basic concepts and theory 114</li><li>Tetrachords and jins 118</li><li>Hijaz and phrygian 120</li><li>‘¡Viva España!’ 128</li><li>Balkan modes 134</li><li>Bartók modes 138</li><li>Summary in 14 points 146</li><li>One last point 147</li></ul><a href=#chapter-4><h2 id=chapter-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 4.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-14-points-2><h3 id=summary-in-14-points-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 14 points</h3></a><ol><li>Modes containing less than seven tones are no more empty than
modes containing more than seven are necessarily cluttered.</li><li>TRITONIC AND TETRATONIC melody is common in many parts of
the world, including the urban West.</li><li>PENTATONIC melody is found all over the world. ANHEMITONIC
PENTATONICISM (what can be played on only the black notes of a pi‐
ano keyboard) is particularly common.</li><li>An anhemitonic PENTATONIC OCTAVE contains three whole tone
steps and two steps of 1½ tones.</li><li>The constituent tones in any anhemitonic pentatonic mode are
related to each other by SIMPLE PITCH FREQUENCY RATIOS .</li><li>Anhemitonic pentatonic modes can have DOH, RÉ, MI, SOL or LA
as tonal centre. The DOH‐PENTATONIC mode is also called MAJOR
PENTATONIC because it’s the only one to include ?. The MI‐ and LA‐
MODEs are MINOR PENTATONIC because they include ?. The RÉ‐ and
SOL‐MODE s are QUARTAL PENTATONIC because they contain ? but
neither ? nor ?. MI‐PENTATONIC is unusual because it has no ?.</li><li>The most familiar pentatonic modes in the West are those based
on DOH and LA. Blues pentatonicism is essentially based on those
two modes. The DOH‐PENTATONIC BLUES mode is common in pre‐ war jazz and
in gospel‐related styles. The LA‐PENTATONIC BLUES mode is more common in
guitar blues, in blues‐based rock and ‘cool’ jazz.</li><li>HEXATONIC MELODY is extremely common but no accepted ter minology exists
for the designation of tonical hexatonic modes.</li><li>TONICAL HEXATONIC MODES used in the West consist of a heptatonic tetrachord
and a pentatonic trichord. There are nine such modes that can be played on
the white notes of a piano keyboard and that contain a perfect fifth.
A hexatonic octave of this sort contains four whole‐tone steps, one semitone
step and one step of 1½ tones.</li><li>Hexatonic modes in common use are the seventhless DOH‐ HEXATONIC,
the sixthless LA‐HEXATONIC and the thirdless RÉ‐HEXATONIC.</li><li>The WHOLE‐TONE SCALE is also hexatonic but it is non‐tonical
because it contains neither perfect fifth nor perfect fourth.</li><li>The OCTATONIC SCALE runs in alternate steps of whole and half
tones. It also has a non‐tonical character because it contains either
no perfect fourth or no perfect fifth.</li><li>The whole‐tone and octatonic scales can only be transposed to
one other position. They are both often used as mystery cues in
film and TV.</li><li>The culturally specific use of modes to suggest geo‐cultural
identity is often confused and ethnocentric but it can still work on
audiences who are not the object of that identification.</li></ol><a href=#subjects-3><h3 id=subjects-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Non‐heptatonic modes 151</li><li>Tritonic and tetratonic 151</li><li>Pentatonic 153</li><li>Anhemitonic pentatonic 154</li><li>Doh‐pentatonic 154</li><li>La‐pentatonic 155</li><li>Ré‐pentatonic 156</li><li>Blues pentatonic 158</li><li>Doh‐pentatonic blues 159</li><li>La‐pentatonic blues 161</li><li>Theoretical bridge from five to six 163</li><li>Hexatonic modes 165</li><li>No names 165</li><li>Major hexatonic 169</li><li>Minor or la‐hexatonic 170</li><li>Quartal or ré hexatonic 172</li><li>Non‐tonical modes 173</li><li>The whole‐tone scale 173</li><li>Octatonic 175</li><li>Final thoughts on non‐ionian modes 175</li><li>Summary in 14 points 177</li></ul><a href=#chapter-5><h2 id=chapter-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 5.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-11-points><h3 id=summary-in-11-points><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 11 points</h3></a><ol><li>Melody is a MONODIC TONAL STRAND of music that is EASY TO RECOGNISE,

anthems and many types of popular song, as well as in most forms of jazz, can
be summarised as follows.</p><ol><li>Chords are constructed by stacking superimposed thirds (ter‐ tial chord
structure).</li><li>Default mode is ionian, the only mode in which a tertial tetrad on any
degree of the relevant heptatonic scale contains two leading notes in
relation to the tonic triad (I); in the ionian mode that tetrad falls on
scale degree 5 (V7) and is called a dominant seventh.</li><li>Voice‐leading (how individual notes in one chord link to indi‐ vidual notes
in the following one) is important: flat sevenths de‐ scend, sharp sevenths
rise, voices may move in parallel thirds or sixths but never in parallel
octaves or fifths.</li><li>Inversions of tertial triads and tetrads are quite common, as are conjunct
bass lines.</li><li>Initial outward harmonic movement (harmonic departure) tends to go
sharpwards (clockwise) but the majority of chord changes proceed
flatward (anticlockwise) round the key clock, ending with a V-I
cadence ([vii?] iii?] vi?] ii or IV?] V?I) (har‐ monic return).</li><li>Only the V-I cadence is considered full, complete or perfect;
classical harmony’s three other cadence types are called:<ol><li>‘half’ or ‘imperfect’,</li><li>‘plagal’ (= ‘oblique’) and</li><li>‘interrupted’/‘false’/‘deceptive’.</li></ol></li></ol><a href=#subjects-7><h3 id=subjects-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>‘Classical’ harmony 245</li><li>Intro 245 History and definitions 247</li><li>Classical harmony 249 Triads and tertial 249</li><li>Syntax, narrative, and linear ‘function 252</li><li>Voice leading, the ionian mode, modulation and directionality 252</li><li>The key clock (circle of fifths) 255</li><li>Cadential mini‐excursion 258</li><li>The key clock (reprise) 261</li><li>Circle‐of‐fifths progressions 262</li><li>Anticlockwise/flatwards 262</li><li>Clockwise/sharpwards: a provisional note 264</li><li>Partial dissolution of classical harmony 265</li><li>Classical harmony in popular music 267</li><li>Summary in 6 points 271</li></ul><a href=#chapter-9><h2 id=chapter-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 9.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-5-points><h3 id=summary-in-5-points><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 5 points</h3></a><ol><li>Non‐classical tertial harmony uses the same basic triads as clas‐ sical
harmony but applies them according to different rules and in different functions.</li><li>Apart from a common triad on the tonic, the most important and
characteristic chords for each mode are, if played on only the white notes
of a piano keyboard, the major triads on F and G.<br>These major chords are positioned differently in each mode: IV and V for
the ionian, bIII and IV for the dorian, bIII and bII for the phrygian,
II and V for the lydian, IV and bVII for the mixoly‐ dian, bVI and bVII for
the aeolian.</li><li>The three ‘major’ modes are ionian, lydian and mixolydian. The others
—dorian, phrygian and aeolian— are ‘minor’ modes.</li><li>Harmony in the ‘minor’ modes often (not always) features an altered tonic
triad with a permanent Picardy third —I consistently replaces i. Triads on
the fifth are also frequently ‘majorised’ —v may be replaced by V.</li><li>Non‐classical tertial harmony is investigated in greater detail in
Chapter 14 — ‘Chord loops & bimodality’. Quartal harmony is the subject of

is based on stacked perfect fourths or on their octave complement,
fifths.</li><li>The basic quartal chords are the open‐fifth dyad (e.g. g-d) and the quartal
triad stack, for example d-g-c which can be inverted as g-c-d, c-d-g, or
c-g-d.</li><li>Unlike tertial common triads, a quartal triad stack and its inver‐ sions
share no unequivocal single root note. For example, d-g-c (DÁ)
inverted as g-c-d produces G4, c-d-g produces C2, and c-g-d produces the
quintal stack CÀ.</li><li>Since notes in quartal triads are related to each other by fourths or
fifths, they are only one key‐clock step away from each other, whereas
tertial harmony’s thirds are three or four steps removed from the triad’s
other two notes.</li><li>Quartal triads contain a central note with a second note located one step
flatward round the key clock and a third note one step sharpward, for
example the g in d-g g-c (GÃ) in which c is one step flatward from g and d
one step sharpward. Such triads constitute a tonical neighbourhood spanning
three positions on the key clock.</li><li>Due to key‐clock proximity and the ease with which tonal centre can shift
between the three notes of a quartal triad, the tonical neighbourhoods of
quartal harmony are more fluid and wider than the discretely focussed
‘keys’ of tertial harmony.</li><li>To effectuate a clear change of quartal ‘key’ you have to shift tonical
neighbourhood by at least three steps on the key clock, i.e. a minor third
up or down. Changing to a counterpoise pole two steps away (e.g. from I5 to
bVII5) creates enough tonal difference to allow for harmonic movement but
it does not ‘change key’.</li><li>‘Major’, ‘minor’, ‘dominant’ and ‘subdominant’ are to all intents and
purposes irrelevant concepts in quartal harmony. ‘Suspended’ fourths and
ninths are totally erroneous notions in a quartal context, as are
‘omitted’ thirds.</li><li>Quartal pentads contain the notes of anhemitonic pentatonic scales,
typically those of the RÉ, SOL and LA modes. Quartal chords are particularly
well‐suited to accompanying melody that includes ?? ? and ??.</li><li>The greater the number of notes in a quartal chord, the more likely it is
to contain thirds and to sound tertial. The ‘eleven chord’ is one such
sonority. It is often used as substitute for a tertial dom‐ inant when the
melodic material includes no ??.</li><li>During the heyday of euroclassical tertiality, thirdless chords,
particularly open fifths, were associated with olden times and ru‐ ral
backwardness. Through composers like Stravinsky, Bartók and Copland, quartal
dharmony acquired associations of modernity that were later used extensively
in music for film, TV and advertising.</li><li>Quartal harmony entered the jazz world around 1960 but many
musicians schooled in the II-V-I directionality of jazz stand‐ ards and
bebop seem often to confuse the approximate voicing of quartal triad stacks
with quartal harmony. Those voicings tend to include an augmented as well
as a perfect fourth, a combination that produces chords containing double
leading notes well suited to chromatic circle‐of‐fifths runs à la bebop,
progressions that are quite alien to quartal harmony.</li><li>Quartal harmony has yet to fully enter the sphere of main‐ stream pop but
it can be found in the work of prog rock artists like King Crimson. Quartal
sonorities occasionally turn up in the work of bands like Police and Oasis.</li><li>Aside from its use in the audiovisual media to connote a sort of positive
modernity (see §11), quartal harmony is probably most commonly heard in
what, for want of a better label, is often called folk rock
(e.g. Steeleye Span).</li><li>In folk rock and related styles, the factors most likely to pro‐ duce
quartal harmony are drones and open tunings based on ? and ?, more often
than not doubled in unison or at the octave. Quartal harmony is typically
produced when ?? ? or ?? sounds simultane‐ ously with the drone notes on ?
and ? (e.g. Joni Mitchell).</li><li>Quartal harmony in folk rock and related styles can be more or less
ongoing. With drones and open tuning the music can move be‐ tween a
relatively tertial and a relatively quartal sphere without compromising
the tonal integrity of the music (e.g. Richard Thompson).</li><li>There is no consensus about how to designate the elements of quartal
harmony. The ideas set out in this chapter are no more than carefully
reasoned suggestions as to how some sort of viable con‐ sensus might
eventually be reached.</li><li>Musical structures cannot be named if they have no names and they cannot
be accurately named if existing concepts shoot wide of the mark.
In this chapter I’ve tried to address that issue with reference to quartal
harmony.</li></ol><a href=#subjects-9><h3 id=subjects-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Quartal harmony 293</li><li>Theory 293</li><li>No ‘sus’, no ‘add’, no ‘omit’ 293</li><li>Basic concepts 294</li><li>Chord shorthand 294</li><li>Quartal and quintal 295</li><li>Quartal triads and the tonical neighbourhood 295</li><li>Crossing neighbourhood borders 302</li><li>Quartal histories and examples 306</li><li>Elevens, the USA and corporate modernity 306</li><li>Euroclassical thirdlessness 315</li><li>Quartal jazz 323</li><li>Quartal rock 328</li><li>Quartal pop 333</li><li>‘Folk’ fourths and fifths 334</li><li>Banjo tunings 334</li><li>Counterpoise 336</li><li>Open tuning and drones 340</li><li>‘The Tailor and the Mouse’ 344</li><li>Summary in 18 points 349</li></ul><a href=#chapter-11><h2 id=chapter-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 11.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-5-points-1><h3 id=summary-in-5-points-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 5 points</h3></a><ol><li>The dynamics of harmony in popular music tend to rely less on long‐term
narrative (diataxis) and much more on tonal variation presented in bouts of
the extended present (syncrisis).</li><li>The indication of a single chord on paper, or in theory, is in prac‐ tice
rarely performed as just one single chord by competent musicians accompanying
a popular tune in such styles as valse musette, rock, pop, gospel, soul, R&B,
funk, etc. (see examples 250‐267).</li><li>Accompanying musicians have to learn how to configure a single chord in a
range of style‐appropriate ways (§2). Such configuration in‐ volves the
inclusion of other chords that provide the theoretical ‘one single chord’
with a sense of ongoing cyclical tonal movement. Accom‐ panimental
configurations of this type constitute the tonal aspect of groove.</li><li>A single chord indication can in aural reality be interpreted as a sequence
of up to five different chords, if the sequence were tran‐ scribed and set
in front of euroclassical harmony students, as in ex‐ amples 268 and 269.</li><li>Equating the indication of a single chord in the sheet music to a popular
song with harmonic impoverishment is a sign of musical naïvety or ignorance.</li></ol><a href=#subjects-10><h3 id=subjects-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>One‐chord changes 353</li><li>Harmonic impoverishment‐ 353</li><li>Extensional and intensional 356</li><li>The wonders of one chord 358</li><li>G — Which G? 360</li><li>Summary in 5 points 369</li></ul><a href=#chapter-12><h2 id=chapter-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 12.</h2></a><a href=#summary-in-16-points><h3 id=summary-in-16-points><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary in 16 points</h3></a><ol><li>The observations listed below are, like the rest of this chapter,
based on widely disseminated recordings of English‐language
popular song released between 1955 and 2005 (p. 372).</li><li>A CHORD SHUTTLE involves ongoing oscillation between two
chords. Each of the two chords occupies a duration of between one
and four beats of the music’s underlying pulse.</li><li>The two chords in a shuttle are normally of equal duration and importance.
The duration of a single chord shuttle does not exceed
that of the extended present.</li><li>Many chord shuttles have an identifiable TONIC (e.g. the aeolian
i&lt;->VI: §13, below) but others do not (see §10 and §14, below).</li><li>The tonic in shuttles consisting of the same two chords can vary
according to tonal idiom, e.g. E&lt;->A as I&lt;->IV in Satisfaction but as
V&lt;->I in Beethoven’s 7th symphony (ex. 270, p. 373).</li><li>The most COMMON general types of chord shuttle are PLAGAL
(I&lt;->IV, i&lt;->IV, i&lt;->iv, IV&lt;->I, etc.) QUINTAL (I&lt;->V, i&lt;->v, i&lt;->V, V&lt;->I,
etc.), SUBMEDIANTAL (I&lt;->vi, i&lt;->bVI, etc.), and SUBTONIC (I&lt;->bVII,
i&lt;->bVII, bVII&lt;->I, etc.).</li><li>SUPERTONIC SHUTTLES are not very common. The supertonic
shuttle I&lt;->ii is plagal in character. P HRYGIAN SHUTTLES (I/i&lt;->bII)
are quite rare in and have exotic connotations (pp. 374‐375). 34</li><li>M EDIANTAL SHUTTLES (I&lt;->III, etc.) are extremely rare. While
I->III works well as a harmonic departure, III->I is highly unlikely to mark a
return (p. 374).</li><li>PLAGAL SHUTTLES are very common and of three main types:
simple (I&lt;->IV), reverse (IV&lt;->I) and dorian (i&lt;->IV).</li><li>Many DORIAN SHUTTLES have a clear minor tonic triad (i&lt;->IV),
while others act as a repeated ii&lt;->V culminating in a final ii->V->I
wih I outside the shuttle. However, it is sometimes impossible, as
in the case of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon (1973), to identify
any tonic in a dorian shuttle which, like all chord shuttles, func‐
tions as an ongoing tonal state or ‘place to be’ rather than as a tonal
process leading anywhere in particular (pp. 378‐380; see also §15).</li><li>QUINTAL SHUTTLES ( I&lt;->V, V&lt;->I ) are common in euroclassical music, most
notably in final cadences. While by no means rare in rock
music, they are much less common than plagal shuttles. Quintal
shuttles seem to be absent from gospel, soul and blues‐related
styles (pp. 381‐384).</li><li>There are two main types of SUBMEDIANTAL SHUTTLE —I&lt;->vi
and i&lt;->bVI, the aeolian shuttle. I&lt;->vi is common in pop music of
the milksap era. It also turns up in 1960s gospel music (p. 384).</li><li>AEOLIAN SHUTTLES (i&lt;->bVI) in rock music are often linked to
things ominous, fateful, painful and implacable; or to modernity, cold,
waiting, uncertainty, sadness, stasis, infinity in time and space, etc. (pp.
386‐388).</li><li>SUBTONIC SHUTTLES —bVII&lt;->I or I&lt;->bVII— are basically mixolydian.
They are quite common in postwar English‐language popu‐
lar song. If repeated several times in succession, they may well be
associated with waiting (p. 389‐395).</li><li>Some apparently SUBTONIC SHUTTLES , like the F&lt;->G in Human
League’s Don’t You Want Me Baby?, have, like some dorian shuttles
(see §10), no clear tonic (pp. 391‐394).</li><li>PARTIAL SHUTTLES can be found in harmonisations of traditional melody
from the British Isles but they do not fit tunes that
return to the first of the shuttle’s two chords at the end of each
verse. They function instead as COUNTERPOISE SANDWICHES (pp. 396‐398).</li></ol><a href=#subjects-11><h3 id=subjects-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Chord shuttles 371</li><li>About the material 372</li><li>Supertonic shuttles (I&lt;->II) 374</li><li>Plagal shuttles 375</li><li>Quintal shuttles (I&lt;->V) 381</li><li>Submediantal shuttles (I&lt;->VI) 384</li><li>Subtonic shuttles (I&lt;->bVII) 389</li><li>Shuttle or counterpoise sandwich? 396</li><li>Summary in 16 points 399</li></ul><a href=#chapter-13><h2 id=chapter-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 13.</h2></a><a href=#summary><h3 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h3></a><a href=#subjects-12><h3 id=subjects-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Chord loops 1 401</li><li>Circular motion 401</li><li>Vamps, loops and turnarounds 404</li><li>Vamp, blues and rock 411</li><li>‘Classic’ rock’n’roll: IV-I 412</li><li>Outgoing, medial and incoming chords 414</li><li>Beatles harmony: bridging the gap 416</li><li>Summary in 8 points 419</li></ul><a href=#chapter-14><h2 id=chapter-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 14.</h2></a><a href=#summary-1><h3 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h3></a><a href=#subjects-13><h3 id=subjects-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>Chord loops & bimodality 421</li><li>Ionian or mixolydian? 421</li><li>Spot the key 426</li><li>Aeolian and phrygian 433</li><li>Mediantal loops 442</li><li>Rock dorian and I‐III 443</li><li>Double shuttle excursion 445</li><li>Ionian mediantal ‘narrative’ and ‘folk’ dorian 445</li><li>Summary in 14 points 448</li></ul><a href=#chapter-15><h2 id=chapter-15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 15.</h2></a><a href=#summary-2><h3 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h3></a><a href=#subjects-14><h3 id=subjects-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Subjects</h3></a><ul><li>The Yes We Can chords 451</li><li>The four chords 452</li><li>Late renaissance and Andean bimodality 453</li><li>Four chords, four changes 455</li><li>First impressions: from zero to I 456</li><li>Harmonic departure: from I to III 458</li><li>Spanish‐language bull’s‐eyes 458</li><li>English‐language misses 459</li><li>I - iii - vi - IV 470</li><li>I - V - vi - IV 471</li><li>IOCM in combination 474</li><li>Summary in 10 points 477</li></ul><hr><p class=meta>Last updated
