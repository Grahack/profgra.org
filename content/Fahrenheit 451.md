## one The Hearth and the Salamander

- pleasure to burn, the firestation
- meeting Clarisse
  - billboards stretched
  - her uncle

ooo
- p7 of course I'm happy
- back home, Mildred took pills, fixed by two guys with a machine
  Seashells p10
  
- p12 the healing machines
- p13 we get these cases 9 or 10 a night 
- listens to the conversation at Clarisse's, then went back thinking, "I don't know nothing anymore" + somnifère

- Mildred doesn't remember anything, she plays with the three walls system, empty of any real thought, she wants a fourth

- GM goes out in the rain, meets Clarisse who fastes the rain, p19 you're not in love with anyone, psychiatrist suggestion, C seems older than M to GM, GM feels like two halves.
- Mechanical Hound (bas p21)
- p24 GM parano sur programmation Hound, guilty conscience (p25)?

- C always there trying things, face sunburnt, describes education, children kill each other, the grandfather of her uncle remembers a time it was not like that, p28: people don't talk about anything, joke-boxes, museum now and before

ooo

- Hound suicide
- p29 C gone
- firemen playing cards, GM thinking and asks Beatty questions (the man whose library we fixed, if firemen had books (the ventilator wind) was it always like this, talked like C)
- rules books, Benjamin Franklin, but alarm sounded
- GM forgets his helmet, citation "Play the man", snitched by neighbor, janitorial work except the woman is here, usually the police arrives before to prevent subsequent mind teasing, she spoils the ritual
- GM accidentally reads a sentence: Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine, his hand takes a book
- the woman kneels among the books, GM wants her to leave but "I want to stay there", she shows the kitchen match and the men rush out of the house
- never by day
- p37 GM felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest

- grosse ambiance dans le camion, explication de la citation, ratent la rue
- retour maison, voit sa main comme empoisonnée et contagieuse, planque le livre sous son oreiller
- lits séparés, joue mouillée
- p39 someone else's room
- p40 when did we meet?
- to cry of not crying about her death
- p44 M knew about C's death
- p45 the Hound is out tonight
- p45 GM sick, he'd like M to ask about last night, doesn't want to call Beatty, wants to quit
- p48 there must be something in books? Trying to describe the fire last night, its meaning
- p49 grandfather and father were firemen, it took some man a lifetime... how long is it since you were *really* bothered? But GM thought about the pills
- p50 Beatty arrives (makes himself comfy and inquisiteur)
- p51 the lesson
- p53 M wants the pillow, then her hand finds the book
- the lesson still, minorities, more sports, more cartoons in books, milieu p55: GM relance sur les pompiers
- p56 a book is a loaded gun in the house next door
- p57 someone doesn't like this book, burn it (example of tobacco and cancer). GM: how did C happen?
- p58 facts of that sort don't change
- p60 "I will never go again"

- p60 no front porches

ooo

- p61 spot-wavex-scrambler replaces her name appropriately
- p62 couple discussion about books (GM showed her) and reading, "I need you so much right now", "Men like B are afraid of her (C), I can't understand it. Why should they be so afraid of someone like her."
- p65 they start to read

## two The Sieve and the Sand

- p67 they read in the Hall, friendship drop by drop
- p68 C's favorite subject was not herself (M understands this title)
- These men have been dead a long time but I know their words point one way or another to C.
- GM turned off the door-voice, blue electricity under the door sill
- fin p69 Won two atomic wars since 2022 but jets in the sky
- p70 inégalités
- passage pas trop compris au premier tiers
- évoque the old man in the park, Faber
- "I don't talk things, I talk the meaning of things, I sit here and know I'm alive." Then he gives GM his address.
- 

## three

- p124 At least you were a fool about the right things. 
- p128 media comme en 2016
