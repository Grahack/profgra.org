## Chapter 1.

### Summary in 15 points

1. A NOTE is a minimal, discrete sound of finite duration in music.
2. PITCH is that aspect of a sound which is determined by the rate of
   vibrations producing it —its acoustic FREQUENCY. Frequency is measured in
   Hertz (abbr. HZ).
3. TONE means a note with discernible fundamental pitch and TONAL is its
   adjective.
4. TONAL means having the properties of a tone. Notes can be tonal or non‐tonal.
5. TONALITY is an abstract noun denoting the state or quality of being TONAL
   (§4, above). More specifically, TONALITY means a system according to which
   tones are configured.
6. TONALITY includes such phenomena as KEY (Tonart), MODE (Chapters 3‐4),
   MELODY (Chapter 5), TONAL POLYPHONY (Chap‐ ter 6), CHORDS and HARMONY
   (Chapters 7‐15). It also includes certain aspects of TIMBRE
   (§§11‐14, below).
7. TONIC is a noun meaning keynote or reference tone for a piece or passage of
   music. Its adjective is TONICAL.
8. TONICAL qualifies music that has a tonic.
9. TONICALITY is the abstract noun derived from TONICAL. It means the state or
   quality of having a tonic.
10. Music without a tonic is NON‐TONICAL (or atonical). Music without tones
   is non‐tonal (or atonal). Twelve‐tone music is non‐ tonical (or atonical).
   It is certainly not atonal.
11. TIMBRE (a.k.a. ‘tone quality’ or ‘tone colour’) is a complex acoustic
   phenomenon allowing us to distinguish between two notes, tonal or
   otherwise, sounded at the same pitch and volume. Its adjective is TIMBRAL.
12. TIMBRE consists of an ENVELOPE containing four elements: ATTACK, DECAY,
   SUSTAIN and RELEASE.
13. DECAY and SUSTAIN are the most readily extendable elements of timbre and
   can be referred to collectively as the CONTINUANT. A tone’s CONTINUANT
   consists of a FUNDAMENTAL PITCH and of PARTIALS or HARMONICS pitched at
   integral multiples of the fundamental’s own frequency.
14. How strongly which HARMONICS are present in which parts of an envelope is
   an essential factor defining a particular timbre.
15. MODES are by definition TONAL. The widely disseminated binary
   TONALITY / MODALITY is a conceptual aberration.

## Chapter 2.

### Summary in 14 points

1. EXTRA‐OCTAVE TUNING exists basically to ensure that all participants in a
  musical event perform any given note at the same pitch. CONCERT PITCH
  (A4=440 Hz) was established as international standard to facilitate such
  tuning. ABSOLUTE (OR PERFECT) PITCH is a side effect of this
  standardisation.
2. INTRA‐OCTAVE TUNING regulates intervals (see §9) between the octave’s
  (see §3) constituent pitches so that they are sounded in a consistent fashion.
3. In most Western music the OCTAVE is treated heptatonically, in the sense
  that it very often consists of seven basic steps (doh ré mi fa sol la ti).
  The OCTAVE is so called because it is the eighth note you arrive at if you
  ascend one heptatonic step at a time (doh ré mi fa sol la ti |doh|).
4. If doh is TONIC and numbered 1, the other six SCALE DEGREES are numbered
  2 3 4 5 6 7.
5. Five of the standard Western heptatonic OCTAVE’S STEPS are WHOLE TONES;
  the other two are both SEMITONES.
6. The standard Western OCTAVE is also divided into TWELVE SEMITONES to cater
  for varying placement of tone‐ and semitone steps in different modes.
  SEMITONAL VARIANTS precede their relevant SCALE DEGREES,
  e.g. b3 as the minor third and M3 as the major third scale degree.
7. NOTE NAMES are identical for pitches separated by an octave. The pitch
  frequency difference factor between two such notes is 2,
  e.g. A3=220 Hz, A4=440 Hz, A5=880 Hz.
8. The OCTAVE is a useful unit when referring to REGISTER. A standard piano keyboard covers a range of pitches from 29.135 (A0) to 8,416 Hz (C8), equivalent to 7¼ octaves. The average human singing voice spans about two octaves.
9. An INTERVAL is the difference in pitch between two tones. Even if
  intervals can be measured in Hz, they are most often designated in terms of
  scale degree difference. In this way the interval between 1 and 4
  (e.g. a and d ««in A»») as well as between 4 and 7 (d and g) is a fourth
  (roman counting: (x+1)‐y=z).
10. Conventional SCALE DEGREE NAMES like dominant and subdominant are useful in
  theories of euroclassical tonality but are irrelevant or misleading when
  dealing with most other types of tonality. The equation of LEADING NOTE with
  scale degree 7 (7 = b7 or M7) is particularly problematic.
11. ‘NATURAL INTERVALS’ are characterised by simple frequency ratios
  expressing pitch difference, e.g. 3:2 for the perfect fifth. Tuning based
  on such intervals is often called JUST‐TONE TUNING and is often heard as
  clearer and brighter than EQUAL‐TONE TUNING. However, while G# and Ab are
  pitched identically in equal‐tone tuning, they can be seriously out of tune
  with one another when treated as natural intervals.
12. To avoid the problem of ‘G#≠Ab’, EQUAL‐TONE TUNING adjusts each of the
  octaveʹs twelve constituent semitones so that each semitone step is
  intervallically identical. An equal‐tone semitone interval is measured as
  100 cents.
13. Many music cultures configure the octaveʹs constituent pitches in ways
  that do not conform to the twelve semitone pitches of Western tunings.
  (Table 7, p. 76).
14. The individual strings of instruments like the guitar can be tuned in a
  wide variety of ways to suit particular tonal configurations, styles,
  modes and moods.

## Chapter 3.

### Summary in 14 points

1. A MODE is the result of distilling a tonal vocabulary down to a set of
  individual occurrences of its constituent tones. These are normally arranged
  in ascending scalar order and delimited by scale degree 1 (1, the tonic)
  at the bottom and top of one octave.
2. Many traditions of musical learning conceive of the OCTAVE as consisting of
  SEVEN BASIC SCALE DEGREES, several of which (typically 3 6 and 7, but also
  2 and 4) are variable in pitch.
3. The distinctive character of a mode is largely determined by its
  UNIQUE SCALE DEGREE PROFILE, e.g. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (ionian),
  ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? (Hijaz). Even so, music in the same mode can vary quite
  substantially in mood and character depending on which of its constituent
  tones are used in which way, as well as on other musical factors
  (see ‘Aeolian’, pp. 105‐112).
4. SIX HEPTATONIC DIATONIC MODES are in common use in the West:
  ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian and aeolian.
  These six modes all contain a PERFECT FIFTH and consist of four scalar steps
  of a whole tone and two of one semitone. The locrian is less common, except
  in heavy metal music.
5. The IONIAN, LYDIAN and MIXOLYDIAN are called ‘MAJOR’ modes because they
  contain ??, the DORIAN, PHRYGIAN and AEOLIAN are called ‘MINOR’ because of
  their ??. The notion that major modes are happy and minor modes sad is
  questionable.
6. The IONIAN mode has equivalents in many music cultures but no pride of place
  among other modes in those traditions.
7. A vast number of heptatonic modes exist in addition to the six or seven
  more familiar to Westerners. Many of those other heptatonic modes are
  non‐diatonic. Nineteen Greek dromoi and at least thirty Arab maqamat are in
  daily use.
8. Many modes in the ARAB and OTTOMAN traditions contain pitches
  incompatible with Western tuning systems, e.g. e§, ¾‐tone above ?,
  ¼‐tone below ?? and ¾‐tone below ?.
9. A MAQAM octave is often theorised as a combination of two TETRACHORDS.
  This aspect of tonal theory is useful in the understand‐ ing of many types
  of mode.
10. Modes containing ?? or ?? and/or a scale step of an augmented second
  (1½ tones), as in the ‘harmonic minor’ —NAHAWAND— and HIJAZ, are very common
  in the Arab world, the Balkans, Greece and Turkey. HIJAZ is also common in
  ANDALUSIA as one of fla‐ menco music’s two mi modes.
11. The AUGMENTED SECOND interval (1½ tones) and the scale de‐ gree FLAT TWO
  (??) have been used in the West as stereotypical sig‐ nals of a remarkably
  wide variety of ethnic ‘Others’, most notably Arabs, Jews and Gypsies,
  the latter from both the Balkans and southern Spain.
12. The PHRYGIAN is the only diatonic heptatonic mode to include FLAT TWO (??),
  and the HARMONIC MINOR the only euroclassical mode to contain an AUGMENTED
  SECOND.
13. The LYDIAN FLAT SEVEN mode, found in traditional music from ROMANIA, and as
  used by BARTÓK, has tonal similarities to blues modes. It is also
  characteristic of music from Northeastern BRAZIL.
14. ‘Phrygian dominant’ and ‘lydian dominant’ are patent MISNO‐ MERS.
  Westerners raised on a tonal diet of V-I in the ionian mode and who fail to
  hear a final cadence in the phrygian or Hijaz modes are effectively deaf to
  the PHRYGIAN TONIC. Similarly, music in the lydian flat seven mode cannot
  morph into another mode with another tonic by being that tonic’s
  ‘dominant’ without the music ceasing to be in lydian flat seven.

## Chapter 4.

### Summary in 14 points

1. Modes containing less than seven tones are no more empty than
   modes containing more than seven are necessarily cluttered.
2. TRITONIC AND TETRATONIC melody is common in many parts of
   the world, including the urban West.
3. PENTATONIC melody is found all over the world. ANHEMITONIC
   PENTATONICISM (what can be played on only the black notes of a pi‐
   ano keyboard) is particularly common.
4. An anhemitonic PENTATONIC OCTAVE contains three whole tone
   steps and two steps of 1½ tones.
5. The constituent tones in any anhemitonic pentatonic mode are
   related to each other by SIMPLE PITCH FREQUENCY RATIOS .
6. Anhemitonic pentatonic modes can have DOH, RÉ, MI, SOL or LA
   as tonal centre. The DOH‐PENTATONIC mode is also called MAJOR
   PENTATONIC because it’s the only one to include ?. The MI‐ and LA‐
   MODEs are MINOR PENTATONIC because they include ?. The RÉ‐ and
   SOL‐MODE s are QUARTAL PENTATONIC because they contain ? but
   neither ? nor ?. MI‐PENTATONIC is unusual because it has no ?.
7. The most familiar pentatonic modes in the West are those based
   on DOH and LA. Blues pentatonicism is essentially based on those
   two modes. The DOH‐PENTATONIC BLUES mode is common in pre‐ war jazz and
   in gospel‐related styles. The LA‐PENTATONIC BLUES mode is more common in
   guitar blues, in blues‐based rock and ‘cool’ jazz.
8. HEXATONIC MELODY is extremely common but no accepted ter minology exists
   for the designation of tonical hexatonic modes.
9. TONICAL HEXATONIC MODES used in the West consist of a heptatonic tetrachord
   and a pentatonic trichord. There are nine such modes that can be played on
   the white notes of a piano keyboard and that contain a perfect fifth.
   A hexatonic octave of this sort contains four whole‐tone steps, one semitone
   step and one step of 1½ tones.
10. Hexatonic modes in common use are the seventhless DOH‐ HEXATONIC,
   the sixthless LA‐HEXATONIC and the thirdless RÉ‐HEXATONIC.
11. The WHOLE‐TONE SCALE is also hexatonic but it is non‐tonical
   because it contains neither perfect fifth nor perfect fourth.
12. The OCTATONIC SCALE runs in alternate steps of whole and half
   tones. It also has a non‐tonical character because it contains either
   no perfect fourth or no perfect fifth.
13. The whole‐tone and octatonic scales can only be transposed to
   one other position. They are both often used as mystery cues in
   film and TV.
14. The culturally specific use of modes to suggest geo‐cultural
   identity is often confused and ethnocentric but it can still work on
   audiences who are not the object of that identification.

### Summary in 11 points
1. Melody is a MONODIC TONAL STRAND of music that is EASY TO RECOGNISE,
   APPROPRIATE AND TO REPRODUCE VOCALLY.
2. Melody occupies DURATIONS resembling those of normal or ex‐ tended
   EXHALATION —the EXTENDED PRESENT.
3. Melody is usually delivered at a rate ranging from that of ME‐ DIUM TO VERY
   SLOW SPEECH.
4. Melody is usually articulated with RHYTHMIC FLUIDITY AND UN‐ BROKEN DELIVERY
   of tonal material.
5. Melody is DISTINCTLY PROFILED in terms of pitch and rhythm.
6. Melody tends to be RELATIVELY SIMPLE IN TERMS OF TONAL VOCAB‐ ULARY,
   changing pitch more often by steps rather than leaps and rarely spanning
   much more than one octave.
7. TYPOLOGIES of melody can be STRUCTURAL OR CONNOTATIVE.
8. The most common STRUCTURAL TYPOLOGY of melody is based on PITCH CONTOUR
   —rising, falling, tumbling, terraced, V‐shaped, arched, centric, wavy.
9. JUST AS IMPORTANT as pitch contour to a melody’s specific iden‐ tity are
   TONAL VOCABULARY, RHYTHMIC PROFILE (including language rhythm), METRICITY,
   DYNAMICS, MODE OF ARTICULATION, CULTURALLY SPECIFIC MOTIFS and PATTERNS OF
   RECURRENCE, including REITERA‐ TION, SEQUENCE, ANAPHORA, EPISTROPHE, etc.
10. CONNOTATIVE TYPOLOGIES of melody includes such categories as ‘Dream’,
  ‘Supermusic’ and ‘Recitation’.
11. A MELISMA is a string of several consecutive notes sung to one syllable.
  Melismatic is usually contrasted with syllabic, the latter meaning that
  each note is sung to a different syllable. Melismatic singing is often
  thought to constitute a particularly emotional type of vocal expression.

### Summary in 7 points

1. POLYPHONY is music in which at least two sounds of differing pitch or timbre
   are heard at the same time.
2. TONAL POLYPHONY is music in which at least two tones of clearly differing
   fundamental pitch are heard simultaneously.
3. DRONES consist basically of ongoing or frequently recurring notes
   that sound at the same pitch throughout part or whole of a piece of music.
   A drone usually demands just intonation of the other pitches it
   accompanies.
4. HETEROPHONY is polyphony resulting from simultaneous differ‐ ences of pitch
   produced when two or more people sing or play more or less the same melodic
   line at the same time. Heterophony is common in music from the Eastern
   Mediterranean and the Arab world.
5. HOMOPHONY is a type of polyphony in which different strands of the music
   move in the same rhythm at the same time. It is the polyphonic antithesis of
   counterpoint.
6. COUNTERPOINT is a type of polyphony whose instrumental or vocal lines
   clearly differ in melodic and/or rhythmic profile. It is the polyphonic
   antithesis of homophony.
7. Differences between homophony and counterpoint are relative.
   There are often contrapuntal elements in more homophonic music and often
   homophonic passages in more contrapuntal music.

### Summary in 7 points

1. CHORD means the simultaneous sounding of two or more differ‐ ently named
   tones. DYADs contain two such tones, TRIADs three, TETRADs four and PENTADs
   five.
2. The two most commonly used systems of chord designation are ROMAN NUMERALS
   and LEAD‐SHEET CHORD SHORTHAND.
3. ROMAN NUMERAL designation is RELATIVE in that it indicates the scale degree,
   in any key, on which a chord is based (e.g. a C major common triad is I in
   the key of C but bIII in A). LEAD‐SHEET CHORD SHORTHAND is ABSOLUTE
   (C can only be C).
4. ROMAN‐NUMERALS are mainly used to designate TERTIAL chords.
   LEAD‐SHEET chord shorthand is ENTIRELY TERTIAL.
5. There are four types of TERTIAL TRIAD: major, minor, augmented and diminished.
6. Lead sheet chord symbols are built from the following compo‐ nents placed
   in the following order:
   • note name of the chord’s root, e.g. C;
   • triad type, if not major, e.g. Cm, CP;
   • type of seventh, if any, e.g. C7, C^, Cm7, Cm^7;
   • ninths, elevenths and thirteenths, e.g. CY9, Cm^9;
   • altered fifth, if any, e.g. Cm7L5;  TODO
   • added notes outside the tertial stack, or omitted notes and sus‐ pensions,
     if any, e.g. Cm6, C7S4;
   • inversions, if any, e.g. CzÌ, Cze.  TODO
7. LEAD‐SHEET CHORD SHORTHAND cannot be usefully applied in its current state
   to quartal harmony.

## Chapter 8.

### Summary in 6 points

The main characteristics of classical harmony, as found in hymns, national
anthems and many types of popular song, as well as in most forms of jazz, can
be summarised as follows.

1. Chords are constructed by stacking superimposed thirds (ter‐ tial chord
   structure).
2. Default mode is ionian, the only mode in which a tertial tetrad on any
   degree of the relevant heptatonic scale contains two leading notes in
   relation to the tonic triad (I); in the ionian mode that tetrad falls on
   scale degree 5 (V7) and is called a dominant seventh.
3. Voice‐leading (how individual notes in one chord link to indi‐ vidual notes
   in the following one) is important: flat sevenths de‐ scend, sharp sevenths
   rise, voices may move in parallel thirds or sixths but never in parallel
   octaves or fifths.
4. Inversions of tertial triads and tetrads are quite common, as are conjunct
   bass lines.
5. Initial outward harmonic movement (harmonic departure) tends to go
   sharpwards (clockwise) but the majority of chord changes proceed
   flatward (anticlockwise) round the key clock, ending with a V-I
   cadence ([vii?] iii?] vi?] ii or IV?] V?I) (har‐ monic return).
6. Only the V-I cadence is considered full, complete or perfect;
   classical harmony’s three other cadence types are called:
   1. ‘half’ or ‘imperfect’,
   2. ‘plagal’ (= ‘oblique’) and
   3. ‘interrupted’/‘false’/‘deceptive’.

## Chapter 9.

### Summary in 5 points

1. Non‐classical tertial harmony uses the same basic triads as clas‐ sical
   harmony but applies them according to different rules and in different functions.
2. Apart from a common triad on the tonic, the most important and
   characteristic chords for each mode are, if played on only the white notes
   of a piano keyboard, the major triads on F and G.  
   These major chords are positioned differently in each mode: IV and V for
   the ionian, bIII and IV for the dorian, bIII and bII for the phrygian,
   II and V for the lydian, IV and bVII for the mixoly‐ dian, bVI and bVII for
   the aeolian.
3. The three ‘major’ modes are ionian, lydian and mixolydian. The others
   —dorian, phrygian and aeolian— are ‘minor’ modes.
4. Harmony in the ‘minor’ modes often (not always) features an altered tonic
   triad with a permanent Picardy third —I consistently replaces i. Triads on
   the fifth are also frequently ‘majorised’ —v may be replaced by V.
5. Non‐classical tertial harmony is investigated in greater detail in
   Chapter 14 — ‘Chord loops & bimodality’. Quartal harmony is the subject of
   the next chapter.

## Chapter 10.

### Summary in 18 points

1. Unlike its tertial cousin based on the stacking of thirds, quartal harmony
   is based on stacked perfect fourths or on their octave complement,
   fifths.
2. The basic quartal chords are the open‐fifth dyad (e.g. g-d) and the quartal
   triad stack, for example d-g-c which can be inverted as g-c-d, c-d-g, or
   c-g-d.
3. Unlike tertial common triads, a quartal triad stack and its inver‐ sions
   share no unequivocal single root note. For example, d-g-c (DÁ)
   inverted as g-c-d produces G4, c-d-g produces C2, and c-g-d produces the
   quintal stack CÀ.
4. Since notes in quartal triads are related to each other by fourths or
   fifths, they are only one key‐clock step away from each other, whereas
   tertial harmony’s thirds are three or four steps removed from the triad’s
   other two notes.
5. Quartal triads contain a central note with a second note located one step
   flatward round the key clock and a third note one step sharpward, for
   example the g in d-g g-c (GÃ) in which c is one step flatward from g and d
   one step sharpward. Such triads constitute a tonical neighbourhood spanning
   three positions on the key clock.
6. Due to key‐clock proximity and the ease with which tonal centre can shift
   between the three notes of a quartal triad, the tonical neighbourhoods of
   quartal harmony are more fluid and wider than the discretely focussed
   ‘keys’ of tertial harmony.
7. To effectuate a clear change of quartal ‘key’ you have to shift tonical
   neighbourhood by at least three steps on the key clock, i.e. a minor third
   up or down. Changing to a counterpoise pole two steps away (e.g. from I5 to
   bVII5) creates enough tonal difference to allow for harmonic movement but
   it does not ‘change key’.
8. ‘Major’, ‘minor’, ‘dominant’ and ‘subdominant’ are to all intents and
   purposes irrelevant concepts in quartal harmony. ‘Suspended’ fourths and
   ninths are totally erroneous notions in a quartal context, as are
   ‘omitted’ thirds.
9. Quartal pentads contain the notes of anhemitonic pentatonic scales,
   typically those of the RÉ, SOL and LA modes. Quartal chords are particularly
   well‐suited to accompanying melody that includes ?? ? and ??.
10. The greater the number of notes in a quartal chord, the more likely it is
   to contain thirds and to sound tertial. The ‘eleven chord’ is one such
   sonority. It is often used as substitute for a tertial dom‐ inant when the
   melodic material includes no ??.
11. During the heyday of euroclassical tertiality, thirdless chords,
   particularly open fifths, were associated with olden times and ru‐ ral
   backwardness. Through composers like Stravinsky, Bartók and Copland, quartal
   dharmony acquired associations of modernity that were later used extensively
   in music for film, TV and advertising.
12. Quartal harmony entered the jazz world around 1960 but many
   musicians schooled in the II-V-I directionality of jazz stand‐ ards and
   bebop seem often to confuse the approximate voicing of quartal triad stacks
   with quartal harmony. Those voicings tend to include an augmented as well
   as a perfect fourth, a combination that produces chords containing double
   leading notes well suited to chromatic circle‐of‐fifths runs à la bebop,
   progressions that are quite alien to quartal harmony.
13. Quartal harmony has yet to fully enter the sphere of main‐ stream pop but
   it can be found in the work of prog rock artists like King Crimson. Quartal
   sonorities occasionally turn up in the work of bands like Police and Oasis.
14. Aside from its use in the audiovisual media to connote a sort of positive
   modernity (see §11), quartal harmony is probably most commonly heard in
   what, for want of a better label, is often called folk rock
   (e.g. Steeleye Span).
15. In folk rock and related styles, the factors most likely to pro‐ duce
   quartal harmony are drones and open tunings based on ? and ?, more often
   than not doubled in unison or at the octave. Quartal harmony is typically
   produced when ?? ? or ?? sounds simultane‐ ously with the drone notes on ?
   and ? (e.g. Joni Mitchell).
16. Quartal harmony in folk rock and related styles can be more or less
   ongoing. With drones and open tuning the music can move be‐ tween a
   relatively tertial and a relatively quartal sphere without compromising
   the tonal integrity of the music (e.g. Richard Thompson).
17. There is no consensus about how to designate the elements of quartal
   harmony. The ideas set out in this chapter are no more than carefully
   reasoned suggestions as to how some sort of viable con‐ sensus might
   eventually be reached.
18. Musical structures cannot be named if they have no names and they cannot
   be accurately named if existing concepts shoot wide of the mark.
   In this chapter I’ve tried to address that issue with reference to quartal
   harmony.

1. The dynamics of harmony in popular music tend to rely less on long‐term
  narrative (diataxis) and much more on tonal variation presented in bouts of
  the extended present (syncrisis).
2. The indication of a single chord on paper, or in theory, is in prac‐ tice
  rarely performed as just one single chord by competent musicians accompanying
  a popular tune in such styles as valse musette, rock, pop, gospel, soul, R&B,
  funk, etc. (see examples 250‐267).
3. Accompanying musicians have to learn how to configure a single chord in a
  range of style‐appropriate ways (§2). Such configuration in‐ volves the
  inclusion of other chords that provide the theoretical ‘one single chord’
  with a sense of ongoing cyclical tonal movement. Accom‐ panimental
  configurations of this type constitute the tonal aspect of groove.
4. A single chord indication can in aural reality be interpreted as a sequence
  of up to five different chords, if the sequence were tran‐ scribed and set
  in front of euroclassical harmony students, as in ex‐ amples 268 and 269.
5. Equating the indication of a single chord in the sheet music to a popular
  song with harmonic impoverishment is a sign of musical naïvety or ignorance.

## Chapter 12.

### Summary in 16 points

1. The observations listed below are, like the rest of this chapter,
  based on widely disseminated recordings of English‐language
  popular song released between 1955 and 2005 (p. 372).
2. A CHORD SHUTTLE involves ongoing oscillation between two
  chords. Each of the two chords occupies a duration of between one
  and four beats of the music’s underlying pulse.
3. The two chords in a shuttle are normally of equal duration and importance.
  The duration of a single chord shuttle does not exceed
  that of the extended present.
4. Many chord shuttles have an identifiable TONIC (e.g. the aeolian
  i<->VI: §13, below) but others do not (see §10 and §14, below).
5. The tonic in shuttles consisting of the same two chords can vary
  according to tonal idiom, e.g. E<->A as I<->IV in Satisfaction but as
  V<->I in Beethoven’s 7th symphony (ex. 270, p. 373).
6. The most COMMON general types of chord shuttle are PLAGAL
  (I<->IV, i<->IV, i<->iv, IV<->I, etc.) QUINTAL (I<->V, i<->v, i<->V, V<->I,
  etc.), SUBMEDIANTAL (I<->vi, i<->bVI, etc.), and SUBTONIC (I<->bVII,
  i<->bVII, bVII<->I, etc.).
7. SUPERTONIC SHUTTLES are not very common. The supertonic
  shuttle I<->ii is plagal in character. P HRYGIAN SHUTTLES (I/i<->bII)
  are quite rare in and have exotic connotations (pp. 374‐375). 34
8. M EDIANTAL SHUTTLES (I<->III, etc.) are extremely rare. While
 I->III works well as a harmonic departure, III->I is highly unlikely to mark a
 return (p. 374).
9. PLAGAL SHUTTLES are very common and of three main types:
  simple (I<->IV), reverse (IV<->I) and dorian (i<->IV).
10. Many DORIAN SHUTTLES have a clear minor tonic triad (i<->IV),
  while others act as a repeated ii<->V culminating in a final ii->V->I
  wih I outside the shuttle. However, it is sometimes impossible, as
  in the case of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon (1973), to identify
  any tonic in a dorian shuttle which, like all chord shuttles, func‐
  tions as an ongoing tonal state or ‘place to be’ rather than as a tonal
  process leading anywhere in particular (pp. 378‐380; see also §15).
11. QUINTAL SHUTTLES ( I<->V, V<->I ) are common in euroclassical music, most
  notably in final cadences. While by no means rare in rock
  music, they are much less common than plagal shuttles. Quintal
  shuttles seem to be absent from gospel, soul and blues‐related
  styles (pp. 381‐384).
12. There are two main types of SUBMEDIANTAL SHUTTLE —I<->vi
  and i<->bVI, the aeolian shuttle. I<->vi is common in pop music of
  the milksap era. It also turns up in 1960s gospel music (p. 384).
13. AEOLIAN SHUTTLES (i<->bVI) in rock music are often linked to
  things ominous, fateful, painful and implacable; or to modernity, cold,
  waiting, uncertainty, sadness, stasis, infinity in time and space, etc. (pp.
  386‐388).
14. SUBTONIC SHUTTLES —bVII<->I or I<->bVII— are basically mixolydian.
  They are quite common in postwar English‐language popu‐
  lar song. If repeated several times in succession, they may well be
  associated with waiting (p. 389‐395).
15. Some apparently SUBTONIC SHUTTLES , like the F<->G in Human
  League’s Don’t You Want Me Baby?, have, like some dorian shuttles
  (see §10), no clear tonic (pp. 391‐394).
16. PARTIAL SHUTTLES can be found in harmonisations of traditional melody
  from the British Isles but they do not fit tunes that
  return to the first of the shuttle’s two chords at the end of each
  verse. They function instead as COUNTERPOISE SANDWICHES (pp. 396‐398).
