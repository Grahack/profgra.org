# Why 99% of Intermediate Guitarists STOP Making Progress

[La video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slJr2i1rWZg)

## 1 Music theory is a language not a set of rules

You are never smarter not knowing something.

## 2 Modes are not THAT important

Maybe only Ionian, Aeolian, Dorian, Mixolydian.

## 3 If you work on modes of the Major Scale, work on the MS first

## 4 Find 'your sound'

## 5 Memorizing the notes on all strings

## 6 There are no shortcuts

Do not lose your time with so called shortcuts.
