# How Twitter Changed The World, In 25 Tweets

On Wednesday, Twitter announced that users who pay extra will be able to send their thoughts into the world in tweets of up to 4,000 characters, instead of 280 or less. A few hours later, the site glitched. Users couldn’t tweet; they couldn’t DM; #TwitterDown began trending. All of it — the muddled sense of identity, the breakdown of basic function — confirmed the sense that Twitter, a site that has hosted the global conversation for almost two decades, had become a rickety shell of itself, that its best days were behind it and that it would never be as significant again.

But what, exactly, is being lost? We wanted to capture the ways that Twitter — a platform used by a tiny percentage of the world’s population — changed how we protest, consume news, joke and, of course, argue. So we set ourselves to the task of sorting through the trillions of tweets sent since 2006 to determine which were just noise and which deserved a place in the history books. And then we asked: Could we maybe even … rank them?

What you see below is our list, compiled with the help of experts, of the 25 most important tweets. Like all such rankings, we hope it can serve as a starting point for discussions and arguments, both on Twitter and off. What was ranked too high? Too low? What did we leave off?

Yes, we know: There’s something a little absurd about this exercise. Twitter contains such a wide range of humanity: How do you rank the tweet that got Justine Sacco canceled against the tweet that ignited #MeToo?

And yet this list tells a bigger story about how 17 years of messy, vibrant, sometimes ugly, always lively conversation has shaped the world. Just where did “Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” land compared with “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet”? You’ll have to scroll to find out.

**How We Did It****:** To compile this ranking, Times Opinion rounded up a group of panelists with widely varied backgrounds but one thing in common: They know a lot about Twitter. (The full list of panelists is at the bottom of the article.) We asked them to submit tweets they thought were good candidates for the most important of all time, with the only criterion being that the tweets had to be in English. We used these to create a list, then sent that list back out to our panelists with instructions to rank the tweets in order of importance and to share their insights about them: why they thought a tweet was important or why it wasn’t. We then crunched the numbers and compiled their insights, edited for content and clarity, into the list you see here.

Backstory

The idea of #MeToo, first raised by the activist Tarana Burke, had been around for more than a decade before October 2017. But Alyssa Milano's tweet, combined with the force of new reporting on Harvey Weinstein, suddenly gave it a broad audience — and #MeToo stories were everywhere. Did they achieve meaningful change, though? We're still debating that.

Moira Weigel, Professor of communication studies at Northeastern University

The hashtag #MeToo offered a new way for women to share our common experiences and solidarity without having to spill, or define ourselves by, stories of private trauma. Part of its stickiness also had to do with the debates it inspired about the digital public sphere and its limits. What counts as private and what counts as news in an era when whisper networks, like everything else, have become persistent, searchable and scalable?

Max Read, Journalist and author of the newsletter Read Max

#MeToo is probably the most successful sustained example of Twitter’s ability to raise the salience of a particular issue; even then, #MeToo’s failings (e.g., lack of attention or effort paid to sexual harassment in less-visible-on-Twitter industries like manufacturing or meatpacking) reveal the limits of Twitter: You’re mostly raising the salience of whichever issue to a superuser audience of college-educated professionals in media, entertainment, politics and tech, which can be useful but also limiting.

Would there have been a Capitol riot without this tweet? Arguably not, according to the Jan. 6 House committee, which cited Donald Trump’s followers’ responses in making the case for the tweet’s significance — which also earned the former president the distinction of being the only person on this list with two tweets. “Trump just told us all to come armed,” one wrote. “This is happening.”

Backstory

[The actor and conservative activist’s tweet was the first](https://archive.vn/OyJrl) to give a 2014 controversy over an indie game developer the name that stuck. Gamergate, ostensibly about ethics in game journalism, was about everything but; it spawned the online hothouses that gave rise to the alt-right and QAnon and was the leading edge of modern anti-woke sentiment. It goes too far to say that Donald Trump wouldn’t have won in 2016 without Gamergate, but it would have happened a different way.

[Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)) became the catchall title of one of Twitter’s first major waves of organized reactionary harassment. The name turned a network of (almost all entirely bogus) complaints into what felt to its proponents like a movement.

This snappy rejoinder to an all-white slate of acting nominations in 2015 not only lifted the veil on Black Twitter and its steady stream of jokes for a wider audience; it eventually became [a catalyst for systemic change](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/movies/oscarssowhite-history.html) in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (with the membership intentionally overhauled) and larger entertainment ecosphere.

Dril is perhaps the most famous semianonymous user on Twitter and certainly one of its funniest. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/831805955402776576) mordantly captured the tendency of Twitter to elicit both provocative rhetoric and the stilted apologies that soon follow.

Backstory

A month after the 2016 election, the Twitter user and analyst Eric Garland [used a thread](https://twitter.com/ericgarland/status/808045818024497157?s=20&t=9NCx4_FhCSFjDYDaBAgM5g) to propound a gossamer-thin theory that purported to explain ... well ... everything. The thread, greeted with rapturous praise, derision and confusion, was the unofficial inauguration of an era in which one mode of popular political engagement was conspiratorial theories about the machinations that lay beneath the headlines — which happened to promise readers exactly what they wanted to hear.

Donald Trump’s election seemed to prove to many people not only that they didn’t understand politics but also that they didn’t understand much of anything, so a tweet thread that purported to have answers, even if those answers made no sense, became a lifeline, a tether to something that could make sense of it all.

The Nigerian government exploited its role as gatekeeper to the country’s enormous market, effectively coercing Twitter into agreeing to onerous terms of operation. Across the world, governments and tech companies are engaged in a high-stakes battle for control of the internet, and internet users are paying the price.

[This one has it all](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/wish-unsee-vile-tweet-alligator-attack/): casual cruelty, an extreme position, virtue signaling, moral high dudgeon and a name that references “Game of Thrones.” Was it the collective force of tweets like this one that combined to convince a significant portion of America that another significant portion of America had become unhinged?

Just a completely insane tweet. Perfect example of someone leaning all the way in for retweets and just completely flopping. Really excellent stuff all around.

Probably the funniest thing about the Russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential campaign through insane social media posts is that it’s a huge waste of money to write _new_ stupid tweets from attention-hungry fringe figures.

Backstory

One of the more successful tweets from a 4chan-led troll campaign to get #EndFathersDay trending in an attempt to discredit Black feminism and feminism more generally.

The 2014 campaign was an early preview of tactics that would be deployed by, among others, Russia’s Internet Research Agency.

This tweet offered a preview of the disinformation tactics used in the 2016 election, which frequently used fake accounts to generate identity-based resentments. Black women on Twitter raised an early alarm about this form of political manipulation.

On Twitter and, by extension, on the internet, anyone can be anyone. And all people have to do is grab your attention to make their voice heard, no matter how bad faith their intentions are. And if they do manage to create enough attention, they can hack the rest of the world’s mainstream media apparatus to completely hijack the way we see the world and each other.

Backstory

Hillary Clinton’s deployment of a Twitter idiom paired with a quote-tweet dunk illustrates the extent to which the platform had become important to national politics. But it also demonstrated the difference between having a good social media manager and being a true Twitter master.

A sort of simplistic way to describe the difference between Clinton and Trump on social media is that the Clinton campaign was crafting tweets to get a lot of retweets and the Trump campaign was crafting tweets to get free media from TV news anchors reading them out loud.

Clinton’s slick and snarky social media messaging was crushed by Trump’s belligerent stream-of-consciousness ranting and sent Democrats scrambling for years.
