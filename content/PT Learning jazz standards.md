## 1 Find a recording

Or more (4!) and store them in your ear.

## 2 It's the melody

The chords can be reharmed so learn the melody on your instrument. Sing it while playing the bass or the chords.

## 3 Play the chords on the piano

Even a very simple version of the chords.

## 4 Play, repeat, play

Putting in the Time.

## 5 Change the key

Like learn everything in C or Am.

## 6 No score

Reading is not knowing and prevents you to learn the tune.
