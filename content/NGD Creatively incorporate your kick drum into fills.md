## Me

Exhaustive but not always idiomatic.

Kind of idiomatic when singles and doubles start with hands and paradiddles
start with kick.

## Step 1

### Singles

HK where H is hands (only LH, only RH or alternate).

Josh Merhar added RKRK LKLK RKRK LKL and RHLH RHRH LHRH LHLH.

### Doubles

HHKK (can be RRKKRRKK or LLKKLLKK or RLKKRLKK (or LRKKLRKK or RLKKLRKK)).

### Paradiddles

Kick first this time.

KHKKHKHH, KLKKLKRL

## Step 2Â : Threes

HKK or HHK

And you can add your left foot (high hat) on the quarters.

### Step 3

RLRK, that you can mix with step 1 and 2.

### Bonham triplets

At 24'05", and please add the high hat with your left foot.
