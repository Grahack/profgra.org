### What’s in a Name?

I am one of those people who believes that language and words are important. Words, when used improperly or maliciously, can hurt, diminish, or belittle the importance of something. I insist that First Nations, Native, Aboriginal, and Tsimshian all be capitalized as they describe an entire people, just like Italian and Japanese do. Elder and Chief are equally important as they hold very important and distinguished places within First Nations communities, just like Mayors, Chiefs of Police, or Premiers do in mainstream communities.

While some First Nations people embrace the term ‘Indian,’ many do not. Many of those who do use it, especially in the United States, do so as they are referred to as ‘Indians’ in treaties and other government documents, which are the basis for their legal and political relationship with federal and state governments. Some will only use it amongst other First Nations people. Most who do not use it, do not because we do not believe that we should embrace a term that was forced upon us by an explorer who got lost on his way to India to find spices. In the USA, the terms most widely accepted are Native American, American Indian, and Alaskan Native. In Canada, the term First Nations is more widely accepted as it was chosen in consultation with First Nations people, and it acknowledges that we were here first and that we are made up of many distinct Nations. Unfortunately, over the last few years, many politicians and onreserve people have started to use the name ‘First Nations’ only to refer to on-reserve people as a way of distinguishing themselves for governments who need to have these sorts of things spelled out for them I guess. Once again, our actions and names are being dictated by an outside source rather than us defining what we are called as a people. It is not up to politicians, First Nations or not, to tell me or any other First Nations person who we are and what we should be called.

While it is not the belief of most First Nations people that we should have to prove our right to our land and resources, we are forced to work within a foreign system which has been imposed upon us despite the existence of treaties or unceded territories. Until such a day comes when we no longer have to adhere to the Canadian justice system at the expense of our own, we will have to play by their rules in order to have access to what is rightfully and inherently ours.

### Ideas

- Include the true history of North America from first contact to modern times in the curriculum

- Include the true history and strengths of First Nations people within the curriculum

- Make the school and classroom a welcoming place for First Nations parents and include them in activities other than just teaching beading or making bannock

- Remember that most First Nations people live in poverty, so decrease or waive fees for outings, lunches, and extra curricular activities to ensure that First Nations youth have equal access to these important things that help to increase their chance of staying in, and doing well in school

- Ensure issues of racism and bullying are addressed immediately and at a systemic level

- Ensure that First Nations youth have equal access to homework clubs and tutors

- Ensure that First Nations parents have equal access to programs that teach parents how to help their child study and learn

- Continue evaluating what schools and schools districts are doing and seek out best practices to implement

- In urban settings, partner with First Nations and other not for-profit organizations to help provide supports to First Nations children, youth, and families 10. Hire qualified First Nations teachers and administrators, or if they aren’t available, then hire and train others who are committed to helping First Nations students to succeed
